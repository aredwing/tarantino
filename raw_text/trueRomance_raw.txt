EXT. CADILLAC BAR - TWILIGHT
Gotham city rises up in the b.g.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

A smoky cocktail bar in downtown Detroit.
CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster, hepcat, is trying to
pick up on an older lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered
by him, in fact, she's a little charmed. But, you can
tell that she isn't going to leave her barstool.
                         CLARENCE
           In Jailhouse Rock, he's everything
           rockabilly's about. I mean, he is
           rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty,
           rude. In that movie he couldn't
           give a fuck about anything except
           rockin' and rollin', livin' fast,
           dyin' young, and leaving a good
           lookin' corpse.

                       CLARENCE (CONT'D)
         I love that scene where after
         he's made it big he's throwing
         a big cocktail party, and all
         these highborws are there, and
         he's singing, 'Baby You're So
         Square... Baby, I Don't Care.'
         Now, they got him dressed like a
         dick. He's wearing these stupid
         lookin' pants, this horrible
         sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater
         boy. I even think they got him
         wearin' penny loafers. Despite
         all that shit, all the highbrows
         at the party, big house, stupid
         clothes, he's still a rude lookin'
         motherfucker. I'd watch that
         hillbilly and I'd want to be him
         so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm
         no fag, but Elvis was good
         lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier
         than most women. I always said
         if I ever had to fuck a guy...
         I mean had to cuz my life depended
         on it... I'd fuck Elvis.
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.
                       LUCY
         I'd fuck Elvis.
                       CLARENCE
         Really?
                       LUCY
         When he was alive.   I wouldn't
         fuck him now.

                       CLARENCE
         I don't blame you.
                (they laugh)
         So, we'd both fuck Elvis. It's
         nice to meet people with common
         interests, isn't it?
Lucy laughs.
                       CLARENCE
         Well, enough about the king, how
         'bout you?
                       LUCY
         How 'bout me what?
                       CLARENCE
         How 'bout you go to the movies
         with me tonight?

         What are we gonna go see?
                       CLARENCE
         A Sonny Chiba triple feature.
         The Streetfighter, Return of the
         Streetfighter, and Sister

         Who's Sonny Chiba?
                       CLARENCE
         He is, bar none, the greatest
         actor working in martial arts
         movies ever.

                       LUCY
                (not believing this)
         You wanna take me to a Kung Fu
         movie?

INT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM - DAY
TITLE CARD: "MOTORCITY"

The SOUNDS of the CITY flow in through an open window:
CAR HORNS, GUN SHOTS and VOICES. Paint is peeling off
the walls and the once green carpet is stained black.
On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with
clear plastic bags of cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have
been dropped carelessly around the suitcase. On the far
end of the room, against the wall, is a TV, "Bewitched"
is playing.
On the opposite end of the room, by the front door, is a
table. DREXL SPIVEY and FLOYD DIXON sit around it.
Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic bags and
a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, but you
wouldn't know it to listen to him.
                       DREXL
         Nigger, get outta my face with
         that bullshit.

         Naw man, I don't be eatin' that
         shit.
                       DREXL
         That's bullshit.
BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older
than Drexl and Floyd, walks through the door carrying
hamburgers and french fries in two greasy brown paper
bags.
                       FLOYD
         Naw man, that's some serious shit.
                       DREXL
         Nigger, you lie like a big dog.

                       BIG D
         What the fuck are you talkin'
         about?
                       DREXL
         Floyd say he don't be eatin'
         pussy.
                       BIG D
         Shit, any nigger say he don't eat
         pussy is lyin' his ass off.
                         DREXL
         I heard that.
                       FLOYD
         Hold on a second, Big D.   You
         sayin' you eat pussy?
                       BIG D
         Nigger, I eat everything. I eat
         the pussy. I eat the butt. I eat
         every motherfuckin' thang.
                       DREXL
         Preach on, Big D.
                       FLOYD
         Looky here. If I ever did eat
         some pussy -- I would never eat
         any pussy -- but, if I did eat
         some pussy, I sure as hell
         wouldn't tell no goddamn body.
         I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
                       BIG D
         Shit! Nigger you smoke enough

         So you won't eat pussy?
         Motherfucker, you'll be up there
         suckin' niggers' dicks.
                       DREXL
         Heard that.
Drexl and Big D bump fists.
                       FLOYD
         Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's
         so funny, oh it's so funny.
                (he takes a hit off
                 of a joint)
         There used to be a time when
         sisters didn't know shit about
         gettin' their pussy licked. Then
         the sixties came an' they started
         fuckin' around with white boys.
         And white boys are freaks for that
         shit --

         -- Because it's good!

         Then after a while sisters get
         used to gettin' their little pussy
         eat. And because you white boys
         had to make pigs of yourselves,
         you fucked it up for every nigger
         in the world everywhere.

         Go on, pussy eaters... laugh. You
         look like you be eatin' pussy.
         You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if
         a nigger wants to get his dick
         sucked he's got to do a bunch of
         fucked up shit.

         question. You with some fine
         bitch, I mean a brick shithouse

         Kennedy. You're with Jayne
         Kennedy and you say; 'Bitch, suck
         my dick!' And then Jayne Kennedy
         says; 'First things first, nigger,
         I ain't suckin' shit till you
         bring your ass over here an' lick
         my bush!' Now, what do you say?
                       FLOYD
         I tell Jayne Kennedy 'suck my dick
         or I'll beat your ass!'

         Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne
         Kennedy she'll have you ass in
         Wayne County so fast --
                       DREXL
         Nigger back off, you ain't beatin'
         shit. Now what would you do?
                       FLOYD
         I'd say fuck it!
Drexl and Big D get up from the table, disgusted and walk
away leaving Floyd sitting all alone.
Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching
"Bewitched."
                       FLOYD

                       DREXL

         You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?

         If it came down to who eats who,
         damn Skippy.
                       DREXL
         With that terrible mug of yours if
         Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her
         pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet,
         chow on her shit, and suck her dogs
         dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.

                (glued to TV)
         I'm hip.
                       DREXL
         In fact, I'm gonna show you what
         I mean with a little demonstration.
         Big D, toss me that shotgun.
Without turning away from "Bewitched" he picks up the
shotgun and tosses it to Drexl.
                       DREXL
                (to Floyd)
         Allright, check this   out.
                (referring to   shotgun)
         Now, pretend this is   Jayne
         Kennedy. And you're    you.

Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and
BLOWS him away.
Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.
Drexl, waiting for him FIRES from across the room.
The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder,
spinning him around.
Drexl makes a bee-line toward his victim and FIRES again.
Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back.   He slams
into the wall and drops.
Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves.
As he gets to the front door he surveys the carnage,
spits, and walks out.

INT. LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT
Sonny Chiba, as "Streetfighter" Terry Surki, dives into a
group of guys, fists and feet flying and whips ass on the
silver screen.
Clarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of
him, nibbling on popcorn, eyes big as saucers, and a big
smile on his face.

EXT. LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT
A cab pulls up to the outside of the Lyric. The marquee
carries the names of the triple feature: The Street-
fighter, Return of the Streetfighter, and Sister
Streetfighter. ALABAMA steps out of the taxi cab and
walks up to the box office.
A BOX OFFICE GIRL reading an Iron Man comic looks at her.
                        ALABAMA
         One, please.
                       BOX OFFICE GIRL
         Ninety-nine cents.
                       ALABAMA
         Which one is on now?
                       BOX OFFICE GIRL
         Return of the Streetfighter. It's
         been on about forty-five minutes.

INT. LYRIC THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT
Alabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the con-
cession stand. A young Usher takes care of her.
                       ALABAMA
         Can I have a medium popcorn? A
         super large Mr. Pibb, and a box
         of Goobers.

INT. LYRIC THEATER
It's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny
Chiba taking on all comers.
Alabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food.
She makes a quick scan of the theater. Not many people
are there. She makes a bee-line for the front which just
so happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks
the row of seats just behind Clarence and starts making
her way down it.
                                                    9.

Clarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone
moving towards him. He turns his attention back to the
screen, trying not to be so obvious.
When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks
a discarded wine bottle, causing her to trip and spill
her popcorn all over Clarence.
                       ALABAMA
         Oh, look what happened. Oh God,
         I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
                       CLARENCE
         Yeah, I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
                       ALABAMA
         I'm the clumsiest person in the
         world.
                       CLARENCE
                (picking popcorn out
                 of his hair)
         It's okay. Don't worry about it.
         Accidents happen.
                       ALABAMA
                (picking popcorn out
                 of his hair)
         What a wonderful philosophy.    Thanks
         for being such a sweetheart.    You
         could have been a real dick.
Alabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.
Clarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't
easy, and get back into the movie.
They both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama
leans forward and taps Clarence on the shoulder.
                       ALABAMA
         Excuse me. I hate to bother you
         again. Would you mind too terribly
         on filling me in on what I missed?
Jumping at this opportunity.
                       CLARENCE
         Not at all. Okay, this guy here,
         he's Sonny Chiba.

                 Now, at the beginning he was hired
                 to kill this guy the cops had. So
                 he got himself arrested. They take
                 him into the police station. And
                 he starts kickin' all the cops asses.
                 Now, while keeping them at bay, he
                 finds the guy he was supposed to kill.
                 Does a number on him. Kicks the cops'
                 asses some more. Kicks the bars out
                 of the window. And jumps out into a
                 get away car that was waiting for him.
                               ALABAMA

                               CLARENCE
                 He ain't so much a good guy as he is
                 just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't
                 be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up
                 for life. Hold on, a fight scene's
                 comin' up.
      They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks ass.
                                                 TIME CUT:
      THEATER - LATER
      On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies
      lay all around him. "THE END" (in Japanese) flashes on
      the screen.

      The theater lights go up. Alabama's now sitting in the
      seat next to Clarence. They're both applauding.
                                 ALABAMA
Great movie.   Action packed!
                               CLARENCE
                 Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny
                 kick ass?
                               ALABAMA
                 Sonny kicks ass.
                               CLARENCE
                 You shouldda saw the first original
                 uncut version of The Streetfigher.
                 It was the only movie up to that
                 time rated X for violence. But we
                 just saw the R.

                       ALABAMA
         If that was the R, I'd love to
         see the X.
                       CLARENCE
         My name is Clarence, and what
         is yours?
                       ALABAMA
         Alabama Whitman. Pleased to
         meet ya.
                       CLARENCE
         Is that your real name?   Really?
                       ALABAMA
         That's my real name, really.    I
         got proof. See.
She shows Clarence her driver's license.
                       CLARENCE
         Well, cut my legs off and call me
         shorty. There's a pretty original
         moniker there, Alabama. Sounds like
         a Pam Grier movie.
                (announcer voice)
         She's a sixteen calibre kitten,
         equally equiped for killin' an
         lovin'. She carried a sawed-off
         shotgun in her purse, a black belt
         around her waist, and the white
         hot fire of hate in her eyes. Pam
         Grier is Alabama Whitman. Pray
         for Forgiveness. Rated R... for
         Ruthless Revenge.


EXT. LYRIC THEATRE
Clarence and Alabama are outside the theatre. With the
marquee lit up in the b.g. they both perform unskilled
martial arts moves. Clarence and Alabama break up
laughing.
                       CLARENCE
         Where's your car? I'll walk you
         to it.
                         ALABAMA
         I took a cab.
                       CLARENCE
         You took a cab to see three Kung
         Fu movies?
                        ALABAMA
         Sure.   Why not?
                                                   12.

                       CLARENCE
         Nothing. It's just you're a girl
         after my own heart.
                       ALABAMA
         What time is it?
                         CLARENCE
         'Bout twelve.
                       ALABAMA
         I suppose you gotta get up
         early, huh?
                       CLARENCE
         No.  Not particularly.
                (pause)
         How come?
                       ALABAMA
         Well, it's just when I see a really
         good movie I really like to go out
         and get some pie, and talk about it.
         It's sort of a tradition. Do you
         like to eat pie after you've seen
         a good movie?
                       CLARENCE
         I love to get pie after a movie.
                       ALABAMA
         Would you like to get some pie?
                       CLARENCE
         I'd love some pie.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all
night Denny's. It's about 12:30 AM. Clarence is having
a piece of chocolate cream pie and a Coke. Alabama's
nibbling on a piece of heated apple pie and sipping a
large Tab.
                       CLARENCE
         Well, enough about the king.
         How about you?
                       ALABAMA
         How 'bout me what?
                       CLARENCE
         Tell me about yourself.
                       ALABAMA
         There's nothing to tell.
                                                       13.

                       CLARENCE
         C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be?
         The phantom lady?
                       ALABAMA
         What do you want to know?
                       CLARENCE
         Well, for starters, what do you do?
         Where're ya from? What's your
         favorite color? Who's your favorite
         movie star? What kinda music do you
         like? What are your turn-ons and
         turn-offs? Do you have a fella?
         What's the story behind you takin'
         a cab to the most dangerous part
         of town alone? And, in a theatre
         full of empty seats, why did you
         sit by me?
Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and
looks at Clarence.
                       ALABAMA
         Ask me them again. One by one.
                       CLARENCE
         What do you do?
                       ALABAMA
         I don't remember.
                       CLARENCE
         Where are you from?
                       ALABAMA
         I might be from Tallahassee.   But
         I'm not sure yet.

                       CLARENCE
         What's you favorite color?
                       ALABAMA
         I don't remember. But off the top
         of my head, I'd say black.
                       CLARENCE
         Who's you favorite movie star?
                       ALABAMA
         Burt Reynolds.
                       CLARENCE
         Would you like a bite of my pie?
                         ALABAMA
         Yes, I would.
                                                    14.

Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites
it off.
                       CLARENCE
         Like it?
                        ALABAMA
         Very much.   Now, where were we?
                       CLARENCE
         What kinda music do you like?
                       ALABAMA
         Phil Spector. Girl group stuff.
         You know, like 'He's a Rebel.'
                       CLARENCE
         What are your turn-ons?
                       ALABAMA
         Mickey Rourke, somebody who can
         appreciate the finer things in life,
         like Elvis' voice, good Kung Fu,
         and a tasty piece of pie.
                       CLARENCE
         Turn-offs?
                       ALABAMA
         I'm sure there must be something,
         but I don't really remember. The
         only thing that comes to mind are
         Persians.
                       CLARENCE
         Do you have a fellah?
She looks at Clarence and smiles.

                       ALABAMA
         I'm not sure yet. Ask me again
         later.
                       CLARENCE
         What's the story behind you takin'
         a cab to the most dangerous part
         of town alone?
                       ALABAMA
         Apparently, I was hit on the head
         with something really heavy, giving
         me a form of amnesia. When I came
         to, I didn't know who I was, where
         I was, or where I came from.

                       ALABAMA (CONT'D)
         Luckily, I had my driver's license
         or I wouldn't even know my name.
         I hoped it would tell me where I
         lived, but it had a Tallahassee
         address on it, and I stopped someone
         on the street and they told me I was
         in Detroit. So that was no help.
         But I did have some money on me, so
         I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin'
         that looked familiar. For some reason,
         and don't ask me why, that theater
         looked familiar. So I told him to
         stop and I got out.
                       CLARENCE
         And in a theater full of empty
         seats, why did you sit by me?
                       ALABAMA
         Because you looked like   a nice
         guy, and I was a little   scared.
         And I sure couldda used   a nice
         guy about that time, so   I spilled
         my popcorn on you.
Clarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and
sucks on the straw until it makes that slurping sound. He
puts it aside and stares into her soul.
A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.
                       ALABAMA
         Aren't you just dazzled by my
         imagination, lover boy?
                (eats her last piece
                 of pie)
         Where to next?

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT
It's about 1:30 AM. Clarence has taken Alabama to where
he works. It's a comic book store called "Heros For Sale."
Alabama thinks this place is super cool.
                        ALABAMA
         Wow.   Whatta swell place to work.
                       CLARENCE
         Yeah, I got the key, so I come
         here at night, hang out, read
         comic books, play music.
                       ALABAMA
         How long have you worked here?
                                                    16.

                       CLARENCE
         Almost four years.
                       ALABAMA
         That's a long time.
                       CLARENCE
         I'm hip. But you know, I'm
         comfortable here. It's easy work.
         I know what I'm doing. Everybody
         who works here is my buddy. I'm
         friendly with most of the customers.
         I just hang around and talk about
         comic books all day.
                       ALABAMA
         Do you get paid a lot?

                       CLARENCE
         That's where the trouble comes
         into paradise. But the boss lets
         you borrow money if you need it.
         Wanna see what Spiderman number
         one looks like?
                        ALABAMA
         You bet.   How much is that worth?
Clarence gets a box off the shelf.
                       CLARENCE
         Four hundred bucks.
                       ALABAMA
         I didn't even know they had stores
         that just sold comic books.
                       CLARENCE
         Well, we see other things too.
         Cool stuff. Man From U.N.C.L.E.
         lunch boxes. Green Hornet board
         games. Shit like that. But
         comic books are our main business.
         There's a lot of collectors around
         here.
She holds up a little G.I. Joe-size action figure of a
black policeman.
                        ALABAMA
         What's this?
                       CLARENCE
         That's a Rookies doll. George

                       CLARENCE (CONT'D)
         Did you know they came out with
         dolls for all the actors in
         The Black Hole? I always found it
         funny that somewhere there's a kid
         playin' with a little figure of
         Ernest Borgnine.
He pulls out a plastic-encased Spiderman comic from
the box.
                       CLARENCE
         Spiderman, number one.   The one
         that started it all.
Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama.

                       ALABAMA
         God, Spiderman looks different.
                       CLARENCE
         He was just born, remember? This
         is the first one. You know that
         guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that
         the story of Spiderman is the
         story of Christ, just disguised.
         Well, I thought about that even
         before I heard him say it. Hold
         on, let me show you my favorite
         comic book cover of all time.
                (pulls out another comic)
         Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandoes.
         One of the coolest series known to
         man. They're completely worthless.
         You can get number one for about
         four bucks. But that's one of
         the cool things about them, they're
         so cheap.
                (opens one up)
         Just look at that artwork, will ya.
         Great stories. Great characters.
         Look at this one.
We see the Sgt. Fury panels.
                       CLARENCE
         Nick's gotten a ring for his
         sweetheart and he wears it around
         his neck on a chain. Okay, later
         in the story he gets into a fight
         with a Nazi bastard on a ship. He
         knocks the guy overboard, but the
         kraut grabs a hold of his chain and
         the ring goes overboard too. So,
         Nick dives into the ocean to get
         it. Isn't that cool?

meets her gaze.
                       CLARENCE
         Alabama, I'd like you to have this.
Clarence hands her the Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commadoes
comic book, he loves so much.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
Clarence and Alabama make love in his bed. However,
while they're not missing a beat during intercourse,
Clarence can't shut up. The following dialogue sounds
exactly like what it is, a man and woman in the throes
of passion trying to carry on a conversation.

                       CLARENCE
         You know when you sat behind me?
                       ALABAMA
         At the movies?
                       CLARENCE
         Uh-huh. I was tryin' to think of
         somethin' to say to you, then I
         thought 'She doesn't want me
         bothering her.'
                       ALABAMA
         What would make you think that?
                        CLARENCE
         I dunno.   I guess I'm just stupid.
                       ALABAMA
         You're not stupid. Just wrong.

Their lips envelop each other.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie
posters, pictures of Elvis, anything you can imagine.
The sweaty lovebirds are soaking in a post-passion hot
bath. By the look of the comfort they share, it would
be hard to imagine that they met not five hours ago.
                         ALABAMA
         I love Janis.
                       CLARENCE
         You know a lot of people have
         misconceptions of how she died.
                                                    19.

                       ALABAMA
         She OD'd, didn't she?
                       CLARENCE
         Yeah, she OD'd. But she wasn't on
         her last legs or anything. She
         didn't take too much. It shouldn't
         have killed her. There was something
         wrong with what she took.
                       ALABAMA
         You mean she got a bad batch?
                       CLARENCE
         That's what happened. In fact, when
         she died, it was considered to be
         the happiest time of her life. She'd
         been fucked over so much by men, she
         didn't trust them. She's having
         this relationship with this guy and
         he asked her to marry him. Now,
         other people had asked to marry
         her before, but she couldn't be
         sure whether they really loved her
         or were just after her money. So
         she said no. And the guy says,
         'Look I really love you and I wanna
         prove it. So have your lawyers
         draw up a paper that says no matter
         what happens, I can never get any
         of your money, and I'll sign it.'
         So she did, and he did and he asked
         her and she said yes. And once
         they were engaged, he told her a
         secret about himself that she
         never knew; he was a millionaire.
                       ALABAMA
         So he really loved her?
                       CLARENCE
         Uh-huh.

INT. CLARENCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
It's the next day. Clarence wakes up in his bed alone.
He looks around and no Alabama, but the skylight to the
roof is open.
The stairs are down. Clarence pulls on a large ratty
fur coat salvaged from a thrift shop and heads for the
roof.

EXT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT (DOWNTOWN DETROIT) - ROOF
DAWN
It is early, a time when even Detroit looks beautiful.
Clarence's run-down Victorian apartment building is
dwarfed between Gotham City high rises and 70's glass
behemoths.
On the roof is an enormous Marlboro billboard -- Monument
Valley frames the All American cowboy. On the catwalk,
in a strange green underlight, which illuminates the
billboard, is Alabama. She is sitting on a yellow plastic
collapsible beach chair, swathed in a large overcoat and
blanket. This is Clarence's terrace where he often
surveys the city. He approaches Alabama along the cat-
walk. She tries to compose herself.

                       CLARENCE
         What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I
         do something? What did I do?
                       ALABAMA
         You didn't do nothin'.
                       CLARENCE
         Did you hurt yourself?
                (he takes her foot)
         What'd ya do? Step on thumbtack.
Clarenc unfolds a second beach chair and sits next to
Alabama.
                       ALABAMA
         Clarence, I've got something to
         tell you. I didn't just happen
         to be at that theater. I was paid
         to be there.

                       CLARENCE
         What are you, a theater checker?
         You check up on the box office
         girls? Make sure they're not
         ripping the place off.
                       ALABAMA
         I'm not a theater checker.    I'm a
         call girl.
Pause.
                       CLARENCE
         You're a whore?
                       ALABAMA
         I'm a call girl, there is a
         difference, you know.

        breath, between sobs)
I don't know, maybe there's not.
That place you took me to last
night, that comic book place.
              CLARENCE
Heros For Sale?
              ALABAMA
Here goes: you got a boss, right?
              CLARENCE
Yeah... I got a boss. I work at
'Heroes For Sale.' It's a comic
book store. It's great because
most of the customers only come
in to browse. So I can pretty
much do...
              ALABAMA
       (cuts him off)
What's his name?
              CLARENCE
My boss... my boss is called
Lance.
              ALABAMA
That's him. He called where I
work and ordered a girl for you.
He told them that you didn't get
out much and he wanted you to get
laid... Seein' it was your
birthday and all. But he didn't
want me just to show up. He
wanted me to act like I picked you
up. The plan was for me to bump
into you, pick you up, spend the
night and skip out after you fell
asleep. I was gonna write you a
note and say that this was my
last day in America. That I was
leavin' on a plane this morning
to the Ukraine to marry a rich
millionaire, and thank you for
making my last day in America my
best day.
              CLARENCE
That dazzling imagination.
              ALABAMA
It's on your TV. Shine reading
it. All it says is: 'Dear
Clarence.'

              ALABAMA (CONT'D)
I couldn't write anymore. I didn't
want to ever see you again. In
fact, it's stupid not to ever see
you again. Last night... I don't
know... I felt... I hadn't had that
much fun since Girl Scouts. So I
just said, 'Alabama, come clean.
Let him know, what's what, and if
he tells you to go fuck yourself
then go back to Drexl and fuck
yourself.'
              CLARENCE
Who and what is a Drexl?
               ALABAMA
My pimp.
              CLARENCE
You have a pimp?
               ALABAMA
Uh-huh.
              CLARENCE
A real live pimp?
               ALABAMA
Uh-huh.
               CLARENCE
Is he black?
              ALABAMA
He thinks he is. He says his
mother was Apache, but I suspect
he's lying.

               CLARENCE
Is he nice?
              ALABAMA
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to
call him nice, but he's treated
me pretty decent. But I've only
been there about four days. He
got a little rough with Arlene the
other day.
              CLARENCE
What did he do to Arlene?
              ALABAMA
Slapped her around a little.
Punched her in the stomach. It
was pretty scary.

                       CLARENCE
         This motherfucker sounds charming!
Clarence is on his feet, furious.
                       CLARENCE
         God damn it, Alabama, you gotta
         get the fuck outta there! How
         much longer before he's slappin'
         you around? Punchin' you in the
         stomach? How the fuck did you
         get hooked up with a douche bag
         like this in the first place?
                       ALABAMA
         At the bus station. He said I'd
         be a perfect call girl. And that
         he knew an agency in California
         that, on his recommendation, would
         handle me. They have a very
         exclusive clientele: movie stars,
         big business men, total white
         collar. And all the girls in the
         agency get a grand a night. At
         least five hundred. They drive
         Porsches, live in condos, have
         stockbrokers, carry beepers, you
         know, like Nancy Allen in Dressed
         To Kill. And when I was ready he'd
         call 'em, give me a plane ticket,
         and send me on my way. He says
         he makes a nice finder's fee for
         finding them hot prospects. But
         no one's gonna pay a grand a night
         for a girl who doesn't know
         whether to shit or wind her watch.
         So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is
         just sorta learnin' the ropes. It
         seemed like a lotta fun, but I
         don't really like it much, till
         last night. You were only my
         third trick, but you didn't feel
         like a trick. Since it was a
         secret, I just pretended I was
         on a date. And, um, I guess I
         want a second date.
                       CLARENCE
         Thank you. I wanna see you again
         too. And again, and again, and
         again. Bama, I know we haven't
         known each other long, but my
         parents went together all through
         high school, and they still got a
         divorce. So fuck it, you wanna
         marry me?

                       CLARENCE
         Will you be my wife?
When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.
                       ALABAMA
         Yes.
                       CLARENCE
                ( a little surprised)
         You will?

           I wasn't the school whore. I had

           he played basketball. Then he
           moved away and I didn't have a

           for a little while then broke up.
           I'm telling you all this so you'll

you? And gettin' away with it
every day. Are you haunted?
             CLARENCE
Yeah.

              ELVIS
You wanna get unhaunted?
             CLARENCE
Yeah.
              ELVIS
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in
the face. And feed that boy to
the dogs.
              CLARENCE
I can't believe what the fuck
you're telling me.
              ELVIS
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'.   I'm
just sayin' what I'd do.
              CLARENCE
You'd really do that?
              ELVIS
He don't got no right to live.
              CLARENCE
Look, Elvis, he is haunting me.
He doesn't deserve to live. And
I do not want to kill him. But I
don't want ta go to jail for the
rest of my life.
              ELVIS
I don't blame you.
              CLARENCE
If I thought I could get away
with it --
                                                      30.

                       ELVIS
         Killin' 'em's the hard part.
         Gettin' away with it is the
         easy part. Whaddya think the
         cops do when a pimp's killed?
         Burn the midnight oil tryin' to
         find who done it? They couldn't
         give a flyin' fuck if all the
         pimps in the whole wide world
         took two in the back of the
         fuckin' head. If you don't get
         caught at the scene with the
         smokin' gun in your hand, you
         got away with it.
Clarence looks at Elvis.

                       ELVIS
         Clarence, I like ya.    Always
         have, always will.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Clarence returns.
                       CLARENCE
         Sweetheart, write down your
         former address.
                       ALABAMA
         What?
                       CLARENCE
         Write down Drexl's address.
                       ALABAMA
         Why?
                       CLARENCE
         So I can go over there and pick up
         your things.
                       ALABAMA
                (really scared)
         No, Clarence. Just forget it,
         babe. I jus' wanna disappear
         from there.
He kneels down before her and holds her hand.
                                                       31.

                       CLARENCE
         Look, sweetheart, he scares you
         but I'm not scared of that
         motherfucker. He can't touch you
         now. You're completely out of
         his reach. He poses absolutely
         no threat to us. So if he doesn't
         matter, which he doesn't it would
         be stupid to lose your things now,
         wouldn't it?
                       ALABAMA
         You don't know him --
                       CLARENCE
         You don't know me. Not when it
         comes to shit like this. I have
         to do this. I need for you to
         know you can count on me to
         protect you. Now write down his
         address.
                                           CUT TO:

INT/EXT. RED MUSTANG - DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREETS - TWILIGHT
Image what Bel Air would be like if the crime rate got so
bad that people just said "fuck it" and left. The dealers,
pimps, and filth of the world have taken over. They just
moved right into the large Victorian mansions that at one
time were nice. That time is gone for sure, all the houses
that still stand are in an accelerated state of decay.
Between the houses, in what was once spacious grounds,
there now exists only no-man's lands where all of the
deals take place. The living dead of the drug world
wander about.

Clarence drives through all of this until he gets to
the address written on the TV Guide.

EXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET - TWILIGHT
It's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his
red Mustang. He's right smack dab in the middle of a
bad place to be in the daytime.
He checks his pulse on his neck, it's beating like a
race horse. To pump himself up, he does a quick Elvis
Presley gyration.
                       CLARENCE
                (in Elvis' voice)
         Yeah... yeah...
He starts walking into the large open field.
                                                      32.***

EXT. NO-MAN'S LAND FIELD - TWILIGHT
Clarence has a beat to his stride that says "confidence."
But with each step into the dimly lit expanse, thoughts of
"what the hell am I doing" begin creeping into his mind.
In the b.g., against the dilapidated mansions, Clarence
can see the eerie glow that at one time may have been
fireflies... today it's crack pipes.
Clarence approaches JUPITER, a diseased-looking dealer/
junkie who thinks Clarence is there to score.
                       JUPITER
         My man, let me show you to the
         white lady.

This stops Clarence cold.
                       JUPITER
         I got crack, crank, smack, dope...
         man, I sell hope. Send you to the
         moon and back. Then some.
Clarence walks past him like a man on a mission.
                       JUPITER
         Chill, man, life ain't that bad.
And Jupiter walks off to confront another customer.
Clarence makes his way, more confident than ever,
toward the door of a large, dark Victorian mansion.


EXT. DARK VICTORIAN - TWILIGHT

Clarence steps up to the massive door of the house.
His heart's really racing now. He has the TV Guide
that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand.
He KNOCKS on the door using the HUGE KNOCKERS.
Marty answers the door.
                       MARTY
         You want somethin'?
                          CLARENCE
         Drexl?
                        MARTY
         Nah, man.   I'm Marty.      Whatcha
         want?
                       CLARENCE
         I gotta talk to Drexl.
                                                        33.

                       MARTY
         Well, what the fuck you wanna
         tell him?
                       CLARENCE
         It's about Alabama.
A figure appears in the doorway, wearing a yellow Farrah
Fawcett T-shirt. It's our friend, Drexl.
                       DREXL
         Where the fuck is that bitch?
                       CLARENCE
         She's with me.
                       DREXL
         Who the fuck are you?
                       CLARENCE
         I'm her husband.
                       DREXL
         Well, that makes us practically
         related. Bring your ass on in.

INT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room
continuing a conversation they were having and leaving
Clarence standing in the doorway.
This is not the confrontation Clarence expected.   He
trails in behind Drexl and Marty.
                       DREXL
                (to Marty)
         What was I sayin'?
                        MARTY
         Rock whores.
                       DREXL
         You ain't seen nothin' like these
         rock whores. They ass be young,
         man. They got that fine young
         pussy. Bitches want the rock they
         be freak for you. They give you
         hips, lips and the fingertips.
Drexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.
                       DREXL
                (to Clarence)
         You know what I'm talking about?
                                                       34.

Drexl gestures to one of the three stoned hookers
lounging about on couches in the large living room that
has been transformed from something dignified to a
cesspool.
                       DREXL
                (to Marty)
         These bitches over here ain't shit.
         You stomp them bitches to death to
         get the kinda pussy I'm talking
         about.
Drexl sits down on the couch with a card table in
front of it scattered with take-out boxes of Chinese
food. The black exploitation movie The Mack with
Max Julian is playing on the TV. This is not how
Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is
exactly what he expected Drexl to be like.
He positions himself in front of the food table,
demanding Drexl's attention.
                       DREXL
                (eating with chopsticks;
                 to Clarence)
         Grab a seat there, boy. Want some
         dinner? Grab yourself an eggroll.
         We got everything here from a
         diddle-eyed joe to a damned-if-I-know.
                       CLARENCE
         No thanks.
                       DREXL
         No thanks? What does that mean?
         Means you ate before you came on
         down here? All full? Is that it?
         Nah, I don't think so. I think
         you're too scared to be eatin'.
         Now, see, we're sitting down
         here ready to negotiate, and
         you've already given up your shit.
         I'm still a mystery to you. But,
         I know exactly where your ass is
         comin' from. See, if I asked
         you if you wanted some dinner and
         you grabbed an eggroll and started
         to chow down, I'd say to myself
         'This motherfucker's carryin' on
         like he ain't got a care in the
         world. Who knows, maybe he don't.
         Maybe this fool's such a bad
         motherfucker, he don't got to
         worry about nothin'. He jus' sit
         down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV.'
         See? You ain't even sat down yet.

                       DREXL (CONT'D)
         On that TV there, since you been in
         the room, is a woman with her titties
         hangin' out, and you ain't even
         bothered to look. You jus' been
         starin' at me. Now, I know I'm
         pretty, but I ain't as pretty as
         a couple a titties.
Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.
                       CLARENCE
         I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not
         hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause
         I'm not stayin'. I'm not lookin'
         at the movie 'cause I saw it seven
         years ago. It's The Mack with Max
         Julian, Carol Speed and Richard
         Pryor, written by Bobby Poole,
         directed by Michael Campus, and
         released by Cinema Releasing
         Company in nineteen-seventy-four.
         I'm not scared of you. I just
         don't like you. In that envelope
         is some payoff money. Alabama's
         moving on to some greener pastures.
         We're not negotiating. I don't
         like to barter. I don't like to
         dicker. I never have fun in
         Tijuana. That price is non-
         negotiable. What's in that
         envelope is for my peace of mind.
         My peace of mind is worth that
         much. Not one penny more, not
         one penny more.
You could hear a pin drop in the room. Once Clarence
started talking, Marty went on full alert. Drexl
stopped eating and the whores stopped breathing. All
eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and
opens the envelope. It's empty.
                       DREXL
         It's empty.
Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says
"That's right, asshole." Silence.
                       DREXL
         Oooooooo eeeeeeee! This child is
         terrible. Marty, you know what we
         got here? Motherfuckin' Charlie
         Bronson.   Is that who you supposed
         to be, Mr. Majestyk ? Looky, here,
         Charlie, none of this shit is
         necessary. I ain't got no hold on
         Alabama. I jus' tryin' to lend
         the girl a helpin' hand.
                                                       36.

Before Drexl finishes the sentence, he picks up the card
table and throws it at Clarence, catching him off guard.
Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around
his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold.
Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his
elbow in the solar plexus. We'll never know whether that
blow had any effect because just at that moment Drexl
takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.
All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple
of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to
the floor in a shower of LP's.
Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile hasn't let go of
Clarence.

Since Drexl's on top he starts slamming his fists into
Clarence's face.
Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't
do a whole lot about it.
                       DREXL
         Ya wanna fuck wit' me?
                (hits Clarence)
         Ya wanna fuck wit' me?
                (hits Clarence)
         I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit'!
He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.
Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of
Drexl's face and digs his nails in. He sticks his thumb in
Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek and starts twisting.
Marty, who's in even worse of a position, can't do any-
thing but tighten his grip around Clarence's neck until
Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of
his head.
Drexl's face is getting torn up but he's also biting
down hard on Clarence's thumb.
Clarence raises his head and brings it down hard,
crunching Marty's face and busting his nose.
Marty loosens his grip on Clarence's neck.
Clance wriggles free and gets up onto his knees.
Drexl and Clarence are now on even footing, but awkward
footing it is. The two are going at each other like a
pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, just keep-
ing them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much
damage to each other because their positions, almost like
a hockey fight.
                                                      37.

Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the
head with a stack of LP's. This disorients Clarence.
Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet.
Drexl socks him in the face.   One, two, three!   Then he
kicks him hard in the balls.
Marty lets go and Clarence hits the floor like a sack of
potatoes. He curls up into a fetal position and holds
his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.
Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.
Marty has blood streaming down his face from his nose
and onto his shirt.
                       DREXL
                (to Marty)
         You okay? That stupid dumb-ass
         didn't break your nose, did he?
                       MARTY
         Nah. It don't feel so good but
         it's all right.
Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground, hurting.
                       DREXL
                (to Clarence)
         You see what you get when you fuck
         wit' me, white boy? You're gonna
         walk in my goddamn house, my house!
         Gonna come in here and tell me!
         Takin' that smack in front of my
         employees. Shit! Your ass mus'
         be crazy.
                (to Marty)
         I don't think this white boy's got
         good sense. Hey, Marty.
                (laughing)
         He must o' thought it was white
         boy day. It ain't white boy day,
         is it?
                       MARTY
                (laughing)
         Nah, man, it ain't white boy day.
                       DREXL
                (to Clarence)
         Shit, man, you don't fucked up
         again. Next time you Bogart your
         way into a nigger's crib and get
         all in his face, make sure you do
         it on white boy day.

                       CLARENCE
                (hurting)
         Wannabee Nigger...
                        DREXL
         Fuck you!   My mother was Apache!
Drexl kicks him again.   Clarence curls up.
Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in
his jacket.
Clarence still can't do much.   The kick to his balls
still has him down.
Drexl finds the wallet and pulls it out.     He flips it
open to the driver's license.

                       DREXL
         Well, well, well, looky what we
         got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds
         almost like a nigger name.
                (to Clarence)
         Hey, dummy.
He puts his foot on Clarence's chest.

CLARENCE'S POV
as he looks up.
                       DREXL
         Before you brought your dumb ass
         through the door, I didn't know
         shit. I just chalked it up to
         au revoir, Alabama. But because
         you think you're some macho
         motherfucker, I know who she's
         with. You. I know who you are,
         Clarence Worley. And I know where
         you live, 4900 116th Street,
         apartment 48. And I'll make a
         million dollar bet Alabama's at
         the same address. Marty, take the
         car and go get 'er. Bring her
         dumb ass back here.

BACK TO SCENE
He hands Marty the driver's license.    Marty goes to get
the car keys and a jacket.
                       DREXL
                (to Marty)

                       DREXL (CONT'D)
                (to Clarence)
         You know the first thing I think
         I'll do when she gets here? I
         think I'll make her suck my dick
         and I'll come all in her face.
         I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's
         done it before. But I want you as
         an audience.
                (hollering to Marty)
         Marty, what the fuck are you
         doing?
                       MARTY (O.S.)
         I'm trying to find my jacket.
                       DREXL
         Look in the hamper. Linda's been
         dumpin' everybody's stray clothes
         there lately.
While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty,
Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the .38.
He sticks the barrel between Drexl's legs.
Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in
time to see Clarence pull the trigger and BLOW his balls
to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.
Drexl shrieks in horror and pain and falls to the ground.
                       MARTY (O.S.)
         What's happening?
Marty steps into the room.
Clarence doesn't hesitate.   He SHOOTS Marty four times in
the chest.

Two of the three hookers run out of the front door scream-
ing. The other hooker is curled up in the corner. She's
too stoned to run, but stoned enough to be terrified.
Drexl, still alive, is lying on the ground, howling,
holding what's left of his balls and dick.
Clarence points the gun at the remaining hooker.
                       CLARENCE
         Get a bag and put Alabama's things
         in it!
She doesn't move.
                       CLARENCE
         You wanna get shot? I ain't got
         all fuckin' day, so move it!
                                                    40.

The hooker, tears of fear running her mascara, grabs a
suitcase from under the bed, and on her hands and knees,
pushes it along the floor to Clarence.
Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl,
who's curled up like a pillbug.

in Marty's bloody hand.

BACK TO SCENE
Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.

                          CLARENCE
                   (to Drexl)
            Open your eyes, laughing boy.
He doesn't.    Clarence gives him a kick.
                          CLARENCE
            Open your eyes!
He does.    It's now...

DREXL'S POV
from the floor.
                          CLARENCE
            You thought it was pretty funny,
            didn't you?
He FIRES.


CLOSEUP
The bullet comes out of the gun and heads RIGHT TOWARDS us.
When it REACHES us, the screen goes AWASH IN RED.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The front door swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama
jumps off the couch and runs toward Clarence, before she
reaches him he blurts out.
                            CLARENCE
            I killed him.
She stops short.
                                                     41.

                       CLARENCE
         I've got some food in the car,
         I'll be right back.
Clarence leaves. Except for the TV PLAYING, the room
is quiet. Alabama sits on the couch.
Clarance walks back into the room with a whole bounty of
take-out food. He heaps it onto the coffee table and
starts to chow down.
                       CLARENCE
         Help yourself. I got enough.
         I am fuckin' starvin'. I think
         I ordered one of everything.
He stops and looks at her.

                       CLARENCE
         I am so hungry.
He starts eating french fries and hamburgers.
                       ALABAMA
                (in a daze)
         Was it him or you?
                       CLARENCE
         Yeah. But to be honest, I put
         myself in that position. When I
         drove up there I said to myself,
         'If I can kill 'em and get away with
         it, I'll do it.' I could. So
         I did.
                       ALABAMA
         Is this a joke?

                       CLARENCE
         No joke. This is probably the
         best hamburger I've ever had. I'm
         serious, I've never had a
         hamburger taste this good.
Alabama starts to cry.   Clarence continues eating, ignoring
her.
                       CLARENCE
         Come on, Bama, eat something.
         You'll feel better.
She continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her.
Finally, he spins on her yellling:
                       CLEARANCE
         Why are you crying? He's not worth
         one of your tears.

                       CLARENCE (CONT'D)
         Would you rather it been me? Do
         you love him?
                (no answer)
         Do you love him?
                (no answer)
         Do you love him?
She looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a
word out.
                       ALABAMA
         I think what you did was...
                       CLARENCE
         What?

                       ALABAMA
         I think what you did...

                       ALABAMA
         I think what you did...

         What?
                       ALABAMA
         ... was so romantic.
Clarence is completely taken aback. They meet in a long
passionate lovers' kiss. Their kiss breaks and slowly the
world comes back to normal.
                       ALABAMA
         I gotta get outta these clothes.

                       CLARENCE
         I have your things right here.
He picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in
front of them.
                       ALABAMA
                (comically)
         Clean clothes. There is a God.
Clarence flips open the suitcase.   Alabama and her
husband's jaws drop.
                        ALABAMA
         Clarence.   Those aren't my clothes.

EXT. CLIFF'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING
A big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a
sunrise sky as a backdrop. The song "Little Bitty Tear"
is heard acappella.

INT. CLIFF'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING
CLIFFORD WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing
this song gently to the sunrise. He's a forty-five year
old ex-cop, present security guard. In between singing
he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed
in a security guard uniform.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - MORNING

Cliff's Nova pulls in as he keeps crooning. He pulls up to
his trailer to see something that stops him short.

CLIFF'S POV (THROUGH WINDSHIELD) - TRAILER PARK
Clarence and Alabama are waiting for him in front of his
trailer.

CLOSEUP ON CLIFF
Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down
Cliff's cheek.

BACK TO POV
Clarence and Alabama walk over to the car. Clarence
sticks his face through the driver's side window.

                       CLARENCE
         Good morning, Daddy, long time no see.

INT. TRAILER HOME - MORNING
All three enter the trailer home.
                       CLIFF
         Excuse the place, I haven't been
         entertaining company as of late.
         Sorry if I'm acting a little
         dense, but you're the last person
         in the world I expected to see
         this morning.
Clarence and Alabama walk into the living room.
                                                        44.

                       CLARENCE
         Yeah, well, that's okay, Daddy.
         I tend to have that effect on
         people. I'm dyin' of thirst,
         you got anything to drink?
He moves past Cliff and heads straight for the refrigerator.
                       CLIFF
         I think there's a Seven-Up in
         there.
                       CLARENCE
                (rummaging around
                 the fridge)
         Anything stronger?
                (pause)
         Oh, probaby not. Beer? You
         can drink beer, can't you?
                       CLIFF
         I can, but I don't.
                       CLARENCE
                (closing the fridge)
         That's about all I ever eat.
Cliff looks at the girl.   She smiles sweetly at him.
                       CLIFF
                (to girl)
         I'm sorry... I'm his father.
                       ALABAMA
                (sticks her hand out)
         That's okay, I'm his wife.
                (shaking his hand
                 vigorously)
         Alabama Worley, please to meetcha.
She is really pumping his arm, just like a used car
salesman, however that's where the similarities end,
because she's totally sincere.
Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch
of little ceramic fruit magnets in his hand. He throws
his other arm around Alabama.
                       CLARENCE
         Oh yeah, we got married.
                (referring to magnets)
         You still have these!
                (to Alabama)
         This isn't a complete set, when
         I was five I swallowed the
         pomegranate one. I never shit it
         out, so I guess it's still there.

         Loverdoll, why don't you be a sport
         and go get us some beer. I want
         some beer.
                (to Cliff)
         Do you want some beer? Well, if
         you want some it's here.
He hands her some money and his car keys.
                       CLARENCE
         Go to the liquor store --
                (to Cliff)
         Where is there a liquor store
         around here?
                       CLIFF
         Uh, yeah.. there's a party store
         down 54th.
                       CLARENCE
                (to Alabama)
         Get a six-pack of something
         imported. It's hard to tell you
         what to get 'cause different places
         have different things. If they got
         Fosters, get that, if not ask the
         guy at the thing what the strongest
         imported beer he has is. Look,
         since you're making a beer run,
         would you mind too terribly if you
         did a food run as well. I'm
         fuckin' starvin' to death. Are
         you hungry too?
                       ALABAMA
         I'm pretty hungry. When I went
         to the store I was gonna get
         some Ding-Dongs.
                       CLARENCE
         Well, fuck that shit, we'll get
         some real food. What would
         taste good?
                (to Cliff)
         What do you think would taste
         good?
                       CLIFF
         I'm really not very --
                       CLARENCE
         You know what would taste good?
         Chicken. I haven't had chicken
         in a while. Chicken would really
         hit the spot about now.

         Chicken and beer, definitely,
         absolutely, without a doubt.

         places around where you live?

         a chicken place is.

He gives her some more money.

dad as the door shuts.

         Isn't she the sweetest God damned
         girl you ever saw in your whole

         It's written all over it.

INT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
FOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sides in
their hands silently mouthing their lines. One of the
actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting director, MARY LOUISE
RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clipboard in hand.
                         RAVENCROFT

Dick pops up from the pack.

She sits behind a large desk. Her nameplate rests on
the desktop. Several posters advertising "The Return of
T.J. Hooker" hang on the wall.
Dick sits in a chair, holding his sides in his hands.
                       RAVENCROFT
         Well, the part you're reading for
         is one of the bad guys. There's
         Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's
         already been cast as Brian.
         And you're reading for the part of
         Marty. Now in this scene you're
         both in a car and Bill Shatner's
         hanging on the hood. And what
         you're trying to do is get him off.

         If we decided on making him a
         New York type, could you do that?
                        DICK
         Sure.   No problem.
                       RAVENCROFT
         Could we try it now?

                       DICK
         Absolutely.
Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with
a Brooklyn accent.
                       DICK
         Where'd he come from?
                       RAVENCROFT
                (monotone as before)
         I don't know. He just appeared
         like magic.
                       DICK
         Well, don't just sit there,
         shoot him.
Ravnecroft puts her script down.
                                                   49.

                       RAVENCROFT
         Well, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed.
         You're a very fine actor.
Dick smiles.


INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY
Cliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to
come to grips with what Clarence has told him.
                       CLARENCE
         Look, I know this is pretty heavy
         duty, so if you wanna explode,
         feel free.

                       CLIFF
         You're always makin' jokes. That's
         what you do, isn't it? Make jokes.
         Makin' jokes is the one good thing
         you're good at, isn't it? But
         if you make a joke about this --
                (raising his voice)
         -- I'm gonna go completely out
         of my fucking head!
Cliff pauses and collects himself.
                       CLIFF
         What do you want from me?
                          CLARENCE
         What?
                       CLIFF
         Stop acting like an infant. You're
         here because you want me to help
         you in some way. What do you
         need from me? You need money?
                       CLARENCE
         Do you still have friends on
         the force?
                       CLIFF
         Yes, I still have friends on the
         force.
                       CLARENCE
         Could you find out if they know
         anything? I don't think they know
         shit about us. But I don't wanna
         'think,' I wanna 'know.' You could
         find out for sure what's goin' on.
                (pause)
         Daddy?

                       CLIFF
         What makes you think I could
         do that?
                       CLARENCE
         You were a cop.
                       CLIFF
         What makes you think I would
         do that?
                         CLARENCE
         I'm your son.
                       CLIFF
         You've got it all worked out,
         don't you?

                       CLARENCE
         Look, Goddamnit, I never asked you
         for a Goddamn thing! I've tried
         to make your parental obligation
         as easy as possible. After Mom
         divorced you did I ever ask you
         for anything? When I wouldn't
         see ya for six months to a year
         at a time, did I ever get in your
         shit about it? No! It was always:
         'Okay,' 'No problem,' 'You're a busy
         guy, I understand.' The whole time
         you were a drunk, did I ever point
         my finger at you and talk shit?
         No! Everybody else did. I never
         did. you see, I know that you're
         just a bad parent. You're not
         really very good at it. But I
         know you love me. I'm basically
         a pretty resourceful guy. If I
         didn't really need it I wouldn't
         ask. And if you say no, don't
         worry about it. I'm gone. No
         problem.
Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag.
                       ALABAMA
         The forager's back.
                       CLARENCE
         Thank God. I could eat a horse
         if you slap enough catsup on it.
                       ALABAMA
         I didn't get any chicken.
                         CLARENCE

EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY
Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang.
Alabama is amusing herself by doing cartwheels and
handstands in the background.
                       CLIFF
         They have nothing. In fact,
         they think it's drug related.
                        CLARENCE
         Do tell.   Why drug related?

                       CLIFF
         Apparently Drexl had his big toe
         stuck in shit like that.
                          CLARENCE
         No shit?
                       CLIFF
         Yeah, Drexl had an association with
         a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name
         mean anything to you?
                          CLARENCE
         Nope.
                       CLIFF
         If you don't hang around his circle,
         no reason it should.
                          CLARENCE
         Who is he?
                       CLIFF
         Gangster. Drug dealer. Somebody
         you don't want on your ass. Look,
         Clarence, the more I hear about
         this Drexl fucker, the more I
         think you did the right thing. That
         guy wasn't just some wild flake.
                       CLARENCE
         That's what I've been tellin' ya.
         The guy was like a mad dog. So
         the cops aren't looking for me?
                       CLIFF
         Nah, until they hear something
         better they'll assume Drexl and Blue
         Lou had a falling out. So once you
         leave town I wouldn't worry about it.
                                                       52.

Clarence sticks his hand out to shake.    Cliff takes it.
                       CLARENCE
         Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really
         came through for me.
                       CLIFF
         I got some money I can give you --
                       CLARENCE
         Keep it.
                       CLIFF
         Well, son, I want you to know I
         hope everything works out with you
         and Alabama. I like her. I think
         you make a cute couple.

                       CLARENCE
         We do make a cute couple, don't we?
                       CLIFF
         Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble.
         Remember, you gotta wife to think
         about now. Quit fuckin' around.
                (pause)
         I love you, son.
They hug each other.
Clarence takes a piece of paper out and puts it into
Cliff's hand.
                       CLARENCE
         This is Dick's number in Hollywood.
         We don't know where we'll be, but
         you can get a hold of me through him.

Clarence turns toward Alabama's direction and yells to her.
                       CLARENCE
         Bama, we're outta here.   Kiss
         pops goodbye.
Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her
arms around Cliff and gives him a big smackeroo on the
lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's babbling
like a Fresca.
                       ALABAMA
         'Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you
         again real soon.
                       CLARENCE
                (mock anger)
         What kind of daughterly smackeroo
         was that?
                                                     53.

                        ALABAMA
         Oh, hush up.
The two get into the Mustang.
                       CLARENCE
                (to Cliff)
         We'll send you a postcard as soon
         as we get to Hollywood.
Clarence STARTS the ENGINE.   The convertible roof opens
as they talk.
                       CLIFF
         Bama, you take care of that one
         for me. Keep him out of trouble.

                       ALABAMA
         Don't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin'
         this fella on a short leash.
Clarence, slowly, starts driving away.
                       CLARENCE
                (to Cliff)
         As the sun sets slowly in the
         west we bid a fond farewell to all
         the friends we've made... and with
         a touch of melancholy we look
         foreward to the time when we will
         all be together again.
Clarence PEELS OUT, shooting a shower of gravel up in
the air.
As the Mustang disappears, Cliff runs his tongue over
his lips.

                       CLIFF
         The son of a bitch was right...
         she does tase like a peach.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY
Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor.
Things are pretty neat and clean. A nice stereo unit
sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet
dancer's feet hangs on the wall.
The PHONE RINGS.   Dick answers.
                       DICK
         Hi, Dick here.
                                                    54.

INT. HOTEL SUITE (LAS VEGAS) - SUNSET
Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge
picture window overlooking the neon filled strip and the
flaiming red and orange sunset sky.
Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand.
                       CLARENCE
                (big bopper voice)
         Heeellllloooooo baaaabbbbbbyyyyy!
INTERCUT both sides of the conversation.
                       DICK
                (unsure)
         Clarence?

                        CLARENCE
         You got it.
                       DICK
         It's great to hear from you.
                       CLARENCE
         Well, you're gonna be seein' me
         shortly.
                       DICK
         You comin' to L.A.?    When?
                        CLARENCE
         Tomorrow.
                         DICK
         What's up?    Why're ya leavin'
         Detroit?

Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama,
wearing only a long T-shirt that has a big picture of
Bullwinkle, crawls up behind him.
                       CLARENCE
         Well, there's a story behind all
         that. I'll tell you when I see
         you. By the way, I won't be
         alone. I'm bringin' my wife
         with me.
                       DICK
         Get the fuck outta here!
                       CLARENCE
         I'm a married man.
                       DICK
         Get the fuck outta here!

                       CLARENCE
         Believe it or not, I actually
         tricked a girl into falling in
         love with me. I'm not quite sure
         how I did it. I'd hate to have
         to do it again. But I did it.
         Wanna say hi to my better half?
Before Dick can respond, Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.
                        ALABAMA
         Hi, Dick.   I'm Alabama Worley.
                       DICK
         Hello, Alabama.
                       ALABAMA
         I can't wait to meet you.
         Clarence told me all about you.
         He said you were his best friend.
         So, I guess that makes you my
         best friend too.
He starts dictating to her what to say.
                       CLARENCE
         Tell him we gotta go.
                       ALABAMA
         Clarence says we gotta be
         hittin' it.
                       DICK
         What?
                       ALABAMA
         Tell him we'll be hittin' his
         area some time tomorrow.

                       ALABAMA
         He said don't go nowhere. We'll
         be there sometime tomorrow.
                       DICK
         Wait a minute --
                       CLARENCE
         Tell him not to eat anything.
         We're gonna scarf when we get
         there.
                       ALABAMA
         Don't eat anything.
                       DICK
         Alabama, could you tell Clar --
                                 56.

              CLARENCE
Ask him if he got the letter.
              ALABAMA
Did you get the letter?
               DICK
What letter?
              ALABAMA
       (to Clarence)
What letter?
              CLARENCE
The letter I sent.
              ALABAMA
       (to Dick)
The letter he sent.
              DICK
Clarence sent a letter?
              CLARENCE
Has he gotten his mail today?
              ALABAMA
Gotten your mail yet?
              DICK
Yeah, my roommate leaves it on

               ALABAMA

Yes.
              CLARENCE

Not yet.

Nope.

Get it.

         Let me speak to Clarence.
                       ALABAMA
                (to Clarence)
         He wants to speak with you.
                       CLARENCE
         No time. Gotta go. Just tell him
         to read the letter, the letter
         explains all. Tell him I love
         him. And tell him as of tomorrow,
         all his money problems are over.
                       ALABAMA
                (to Dick)
         He can't. We gotta go, but he
         wants you to read the letter.
         The letter explains all. He wants
         you to know he loves you. And he
         wants you to know that as of
         tomorrow, all of your money
         problems are over.
                       DICK
         Money problems?
                       CLARENCE
         Now tell him good-bye.

She hangs up the phone.

         Hello, hello. Clarence?
         Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama
         ... hello?
Extremely confused, Dick hangs up the phone. He goes over
to the TV and picks up the day's mail. He goes through it.

A lower, middle-class trailer park named "Astro World"
which has a neon sign in front of it in the shape of a
planet.
A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by
a trailer that's slightly less kept up than the others.
Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a fast
food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.


INT. TRAILER - DAY
He steps inside his doorway and then, before he knows
it, a gun is pressed to his temple and a big hand grabs
his shoulder.
                       GUN CARRIER
         Welcome home, alchy. We're havin'
         a party.
Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting
for him are four standing men:   FRANKIE (young wise
guy), LENNY (an old wise guy), TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fire-
plug pitbull type) and VIRGIL (the quiet one).
Sitting in Cliff's reclining chair is VINCENZO COCCOTTI,
the Frank Nitti to Detroit mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.
Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the
sitting Coccotti. Frankie and Lenny pick him up and
roughly drop him in a chair.
                       COCCOTTI
                (to Frankie)
         Tell Tooth-Pic Vic to go outside
         and do you-know-what.
Frankie tells Tooth-Pick Vic in Italian what Coccotti
said. He nods and exits.
Cliff's chair   is moved closer to Coccotti's. Virgil
stands on one   side of Cliff. Frankie and Lenny ransack
the trailer.    Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in
his hand, but   he has yet to touch a drop.
                       COCCOTTI
         Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
                         CLIFF
         I give up.    Who are you?
                                                    59.

                       COCCOTTI
         I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me
         in a vendetta kind of mood, you
         will tell the angels in Heaven
         that you had never seen pure evil
         so singularly personified as you
         did in the face of the man who
         killed you. My name is Vincenzo
         Coccotti. I work as council for
         Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man who
         your son stole from. I hear you
         were once a cop so I can assume
         you've heard of us before. Am
         I correct?
                       CLIFF
         I've heard of 'Blue Lou Boyle.'

                       COCCOTTI
         I'm glad. Hopefully that will
         clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am
         question you've been asking yourself.
         Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A,
         and at the risk of sounding redundant,
         please make your answers genuine.
                (taking out a pack
                 of Chesterfields)
         Want a Chesterfield?
                       CLIFF
         No.
                       COCCOTTI
                (as he lights one up)
         I have a son of my own. About your
         boy's age. I can imagine how
         painful this must be for you. But
         Clarence and that bitch whore girl
         friend of his brought this all on
         themselves. And I implore you not
         to go down the road with 'em. You
         can always take comfort in the
         fact that you never had a choice.
                       CLIFF
         Look, I'd help ya if I could, but
         I haven't seen Clarence --
Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him
hard in the nose with his fist.
                       COCCOTTI
         Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed
         in the nose fucks you all up.
         You got that pain shootin' through
         your brain. Your eyes fill up
         with water. It ain't any kind of fun.

                       COCCOTTI (CONT'D)
         But what I have to offer you,
         that's as good as it's ever gonna
         get, and it won't ever get that
         good again. We talked to your
         neighbors, they saw a Mustang,
         a red Mustang, parked in front of
         your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley,
         have you seen your son?
Cliff's defeated.
                       CLIFF
         I've seen him.
                       COCCOTTI
         Now I can't be sure of how much
         of what he told you. So in the
         chance you're in the dark about
         some of this, let me shed some
         light. That whore your boy hangs
         around with, her pimp is an
         associate of mine, and I don't
         just mean pimpin', in other
         affairs he works for me in a
         courier capacity. Well, apparently,
         that dirty little whore found out
         when we were gonna do some
         business, 'cause your son, the
         cowboy and his flame, came in the
         room blastin' and didn't stop
         'til they were pretty sure
         everybody was dead.
                       CLIFF
         What are you talkin' about?
                       COCCOTTI
         I'm talkin' about a massacre.
         They snatched my narcotics and
         high-tailed it outta there. Wouldda
         gotten away with it, but your son,
         fuckhead that he is, left his driver's
         license in a dead guy's hand. A
         whore hiding in the commode filled
         in all the blanks.
                       CLIFF
         I don't believe you.
                       COCCOTTI
         That's of minor importance. But
         what's of major fucking importance
         is that I believe you. Where did
         they go?
                       CLIFF
         On their honeymoon.
                                                    61.

                       COCCOTTI
         I'm gettin' angry askin' the same
         question a second time. Where did
         they go?
                       CLIFF
         They didn't tell me.
Coccotti looks at him.,
                       CLIFF
         Now, wait a minute and listen. I
         haven't seen Clarence in three
         years, yesterday he shows up here
         with a girl, sayin' he got married.
         He told me he needed some quick
         cash for a honeymoon, so he
         asked if he could borrow five
         hundred dollars. I wanted to
         help him out so I wrote out a
         check. We went to breakfast
         and that's the last I saw of him.
         So help me God. They never thought
         to tell me where they were goin'.
         And I never thought to ask.
Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives
Virgil a look. Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs
Cliff's hands and turns it palm up. He then whips out a
butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours
Chivas Regal on the wound. Cliff screams.
Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.
Tooth-pick Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in
Italian that there's nothing in the car.
Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff
holds his bleeding palm in agony. Virgil hands him the
dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.
                       COCCOTTI
         Sicilians are great liars. The
         best in the world. I'm a
         Sicilian. And my old man was
         the world heavyweight champion of
         Sicilian liars. And from growin'
         up with him I learned the pantomime.
         Now there are seventeen different
         things a guy can do when he lies to
         give him away. A guy has seventeen
         pantomimes. A woman's got twenty,
         but a guy's got seventeen. And if
         ya know 'em like ya know your
         own face, they beat lie detectors
         all to hell. What we got here is
         a little game of show and tell.

         You don't wanna show me nothin'.
         But you're tellin' me everything.
         Now I know you know where they
         are. So tell me, before I do
         some damage you won't walk away
         from.
The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the
awful pain in his heart. He looks deep into Coccotti's
eyes.
                       CLIFF
         Could I have one of those
         Chesterfields now?
                        COCCOTTI
         Sure.
Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.
                        CLIFF
         Gotta match?
Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.
                       CLIFF
         Oh, don't bother. I got one.
                (he lights the
                 cigarette)
         So you're a Sicilian, huh?
                       COCCOTTI
                (intensely)
         Uh-huh.
                       CLIFF
         You know I read a lot. Especially
         things that have to do with history.
         I find that shit fascinating. In
         fact, I don't know if you know
         this or not, Sicilian's were spawned
         by niggers.
All the men stop what they are doing and look at Cliff,
except for Tooth-pick Vic who doesn't speak English and
so, isn't insulted.
Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing.
                        COCCOTTI
         Come again?
                       CLIFF
         It's a fact. Sicilians have
         nigger blood pumping through their
         hearts.

                       CLIFF (CONT'D)
         If you don't believe me look it
         up. You see, hundreds and
         hundreds of years ago the Moors
         conquered Sicily. And Moors are
         niggers. Way back then, Sicilians
         were like the Wops in northern
         Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes.
         But, once the Moors moved in there,
         they changed the whole country.
         They did so much fuckin' with
         the Sicilian women, they changed
         the bloodline forever, from blond
         hair and blue eyes to black hair
         and dark skin. I find it
         absolutely amazing to think that
         to this day hundreds of years
         later, Sicilians still carry that
         nigger gene. I'm just quotin'
         history. It's a fact. It's
         written. Your ancestors were
         niggers. Your great, great, great,
         great grandmother was fucked by
         a nigger, and had a half nigger
         kid. That is a fact. Now tell
         me, am I lyin'?
Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips
out an AUTOMATIC, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the
barrel to his temple, and PUMPS three bullets through
Cliff's head.
He pushes the body violently aside.
Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his feelings and
frustrated by the blood on his hands, he simply drops his
weapon and turns to his men.

                       COCCOTTI
         I haven't killed anybody since
         1974. Goddamn his soul to burn
         for eternity in fucking hell for
         making me spill blood on my hands!
         Go to this comedian's son's
         apartment and come back with
         something that tells me where that
         asshole went so I can wipe this
         egg off of my face and fix this
         fucked up family for good.
Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italian, asks
him "what was that all about?"
Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refrigerator has
found a beer.
                                                     64.

When he closes the refrigerator door he finds a note
being held on be a ceramic banana fruit magnet that says:
"Clarence in LA: Dick Ritchie (Number and address).
                       LENNY
         Boss, get ready to get happy.

Alabama is in the middle of a story.
                       ALABAMA
         ... when my mom went into labor,
         my dad panicked. He never had a
         kid before, and crashed the car.
         Now, picture this: their car's
         demolished, a crowd is starting
         to gather, my mom is yelling,
         going into contractions, and
         my dad, who was losing it before,
         is now completely screaming yellow
         zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as
         if from thin air, this big giant
         bus appears, and the bus driver
         said, 'Get her in here.' He
         forgot all about his route and
         just drove straight to the
         hospital. So, because he was
         such a nice guy, they wanted to
         name the baby after him, as a
         sign of gratitude. Well, his
         name was Waldo, and no matter
         how grateful they were, even if
         I'da been a boy, they wouldn't
         call me Waldo. So, they asked
         Waldo where he was from. And,
         so there you go.
                       CLARENCE
         And here we are.
                       DICK

         Well, she's a pretty amazing
         girl. What are women like

                       DICK
         Just like in Detroit, only

         You can't have just one.

Alabama leaves to get another hot dog.    Clarence never
takes his eyes off her.
                       DICK
         How much of that letter was on
         the up and up?
                       CLARENCE

Dick sees where Clarence's attention is.

         For the very first time in my life.
                (pause)
         Do you know what that's like?
Clarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer.

                       DICK
                (regretfully)
         No I don't.

Clarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his
Hebrew cream soda.

BACK TO SCENE
Clarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.

Alabama's watching the cable TV.
                        DICK
          Holy Mary mother of God.
                        ALABAMA
          This is great, we got cable.
                        CLARENCE
                 (to Alabama)
          Bama, you got your blade?
Keeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out a Swiss Army
knife with a tiny dinosaur on it from her purse, and
tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the corkscrew
and opens the wine.
In a couple of hotel plastic cups he pours some wine, a
big glass for Dick, a little one for himself. He hands
it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.

                        DICK
          This shit can't be real.
                        CLARENCE
          It'll getcha high.
He tosses Dick the knife.
                        CLARENCE
          Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
                         ALABAMA
          Nope.   I'm not really a wine gal.
Using the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine.   He
jumps back.
                        DICK
          It's fuckin' real!

         It's fuckin' real!

         I certainly hope so.
                       DICK
         You've got a helluva lot of coke
         there, man!
                         CLARENCE
         I know.
                       DICK
         Do you have any idea how much
         fuckin' coke you got?

                         CLARENCE
         Tell me.
                         DICK
         I don't know!    A fuckin' lot!
He downs his wine.   Clarence fills his glass.
                       DICK
         This is Drexl's coke!?
                       CLARENCE
         Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's
         coke and Clarence can do whatever
         he wants with it. And what
         Clarence wants to do is sell it.
         Then me and Bama are gonna leave
         on a jet plane and spend the rest
         of our lives spendin'. So, you
         got my letter, have you lined up
         any buyers?
                       DICK
         Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe
         Cocaine.
Dick gulps half of his wine.   Clarence fills it up.
                       CLARENCE
         But you're an actor. I hear these
         Hollywood guys have it delivered
         to the set.
                       DICK
         Yeah, they do. And maybe when I
         start being a successful actor
         I'll know those guys. But most
         of the people I know are like me.

              DICK (CONT'D)
They ain't got a pot to piss in or
a window to throw it out of. Now,
if you want to sell a little bit
at at time --
             CLARENCE
No way! The whole enchilada in
one shot.
              DICK
Do you have any idea how difficult
that's gonna be?
              CLARENCE
I'm offering a half a million
dollars worth of white for two
hundred thousand. How difficult
can that be?
              DICK
It's difficult because you're
sellin' it to a particular group.
Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who
can use that kind of quantity.
Guys that can afford two hundred
thousand. Basically, guys I don't
know. You don't know. And more
important, they don't know you.
I did talk with one guy who
could possibly help you.
              CLARENCE
Is he big league?
              DICK
He's nothing. He's in my acting
class. But he works as an
assistant to a very powerful movie
producer named Lee Donowitz. I
thought Donowitz could be
interested in a deal like this.
He could use it. He could afford
it.
              CLARENCE
What'dya tell 'em?
              DICK
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure
from your letter what was bullshit,
and what wasn't.
              CLARENCE
What's this acting class guy's
name?
                                     70.

Elliot.

Elliot what?
              DICK
Elliot Blitzer.
              CLARENCE
Okay, call 'em up and arrange a
meeting, so we can get through
all the getting to know you stuff.
               DICK
Where?

                CLARENCE

Where?
               ALABAMA
The zoo.

The zoo.

What are you waiting for?
              DICK
Would you just shut up a minute
and let me think?
              CLARENCE
What's to think about?
              DICK
Shut up! First you come waltzing
into my life after two years.
You're married. You killed a guy.
               CLARENCE
Two guys.
              DICK
Two guys. Now you want me to
help you with some big drug deal.
Fuck, Clarence, you killed
somebody and you're blowin' it
off like it don't mean shit.

Don't expect me to be all broken
up over poor Drexl.

         I think he was a fuckin',
         freeloadin', parasitic scumbag,
         and he got exactly what he
         deserved. I got no pity for a mad
         dog like that. I think I should
         get a merit badge or somethin'.
Dick rests his head in his hands.

         Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin'
         some pretty heavy shit on ya, but
         I need you to rise to the occasion.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - CLOSEUP - PANTHER - DAY
A black panther, the four-legged kind, paces back and
forth. PULL BACK. Dick, and ELLIOT BLITZER are walking
through the zoo. One look at Elliot and you can see
what type of actor he is, a real GQ, blow-dry boy. As
they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal
crackers and Alabama is blowing soap bubbles.
                       ELLIOT
         So you guys got five hundred
         thousand dollars worth of cola
         that you're unloading --
                       CLARENCE
         Want an animal cracker?
                       ELLIOT
         Yeah, okay.

He takes one.
                       CLARENCE
         Leave the gorillas.
                       ELLIOT
         -- that you're unloading for two
         hundred thousand dollars --
                       CLARENCE
         Unloading? That's a helluva way
         to describe the bargain of a
         lifetime.
                       DICK
                (trying to chill
                 him out)
         Clarence...
                                    72.

              ELLIOT
Where did you get it?
              CLARENCE
I grow it on my windowsill. The
light's really great there and
I'm up high enough so you can't
see it from the street.
              ELLIOT
       (forcing a laugh)
Ha ha ha. No really, where does
it come from?
              CLARENCE
Coco leaves. You see, they take
the leaves and mash it down until
it's kind of a paste --
              ELLIOT
       (turning to Dick)
Look, Dick, I don't --
              CLARENCE
       (laughing)
No problem, Elliot. I'm just
fuckin' wit' ya, that's all.
Actually, I'll tell you but you
gotta keep it quiet. Understand,
if Dick didn't insure me you're
good people, I'd just tell ya,
none of your fuckin' business.
But, as a sign of good faith,
here it goes. I gotta friend in
the department.
              ELLIOT
What department?

              CLARENCE
What do you think, eightball?
              ELLIOT
The police department?
              CLARENCE
Duh. What else would I be talking
about? Now stop asking stupid
doorknob questions. Well, a year
and a half ago, this friend of
mine got access to the evidence
room for an hour. He snagged this
coke. But, he's a good cop with
a wife and a kid, so he sat on it
for a year and a half until he
found a guy he could trust.

         He trusts you?
                       CLARENCE
         We were in 4-H together. We've
         known each other since childhood.
         So I'm handling the sales part.
         He's my silent partner and he
         knows, if I get fucked up, I won't
         drop dime on him. He's kinda
         paranoid. Now, no farther you
         understand. I didn't tell you
         nothin' and you didn't hear
         nothin'.
                        ELLIOT
         Sure.   I didn't hear anything.

Elliot is more than satisfied. Clarence makes a comical
face at Dick when Elliot's not looking. Dick is wearing
an "I don't believe this guy" expression. Alabama is
forever blowing bubbles.

         Get it straight. Lee isn't into
         taking risks. He deals with a
         couple of guys and he's been
         dealing with them for years.
         They're reliable. They're
         dependable. And they're safe.
                       CLARENCE
         Riddle me this, Batman. If
         you're all so much in love with
         each other, what the fuck are you
         doing here? I'm sure you got
         better things to do with your time
         than walk around in circles
         staring up a panther's ass. Your
         guy's interested because with
         that much shit at his fingertips
         he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood
         till the wheels come off. He can
         sell it, he can snort it, he can
         play Santa Claus with it. At the
         price he's paying, he'll have the
         freedom to be able to just throw
         it around. He'll be everybody's
         best friend. I'm not puttin' him
         down. Hey, let him run wild.
         Have a ball, it's his money. But
         don't expect me to hang around
         forever waiting for you guys to
         grow some guts.
Elliot has been silenced.   He nods his head in agreement.

         But being a distributor's not
         what I'm all about. I'm a film
         producer. I'm on this world to
         make good movies. Nothing more.
         Now, having my big toe dipped into
         the distribution end helps me on
         many levels.
Traffic breaks and Lee speeds along.   The b.g. whizzes
past him.
                       LEE
         But the bottom line is -- I'm not
         Paramount. I have a select group
         of distributors I deal with. I
         buy their little movies.
         Accomplish what I wanna accomplish.
         End of story. Easy, businesslike,
         very little risk.

          Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every
          time you buy one of those little
          movies, it's a risk. I'm not
          selling you somethin' that's gonna
          play two weeks, six weeks, then
          go straight to cable. This is
          Doctor Zhivago. This'll be
          packin' 'em in for a year and a
          half. Two years! That's two
          years you don't have to work
          with anybody's movie but mine.

Porsche is now speeding down a beachside road.

          Well then, what's the hurry?   Is
          it that the rights to Doctor
          Zhivago are in arbitration?
EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY
                        CLARENCE
          I wanna be able to announce this
          deal at Cannes. If I had time
          for a courtship, Lee, I would.
          I'd take ya out, I'd hold ya
          hand, I'd kiss ya on the cheek at
          the door. But I'm not in that
          position. I need to know if we're
          in bed together or not. If you
          want my movie, Lee, you're just
          gonna have to come to terms with
          your fear and desire.

Pause.   Clarence hands the phone to Elliot.
                        CLARENCE
                 (to Elliot)
          He wants to talk to you.

          I told you, through Dick.

         Sure thing.
Elliot hangs up the phone.
                       ELLIOT
         He says Wednesday at three o'clock
         at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants
         everybody there.
                (pointing at
                 Clarence)
         He'll talk to you. If after
         talkin' to you he's convinced
         you're okay, he'll do business.
         If not, he'll say, 'Fuck it' and
         walk out the door. He also wants
         a sample bag.
                       CLARENCE
         No problem on counts.
He offers Elliot the animal crackers.
                       CLARENCE
         Have a cookie.
Elliot takes one.
                         ELLIOT
         Thanks.
He puts it in his mouth.

         That wasn't a gorilla, was it?


EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY
The red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the
hotel. Alabama hops out, Clarence stays in.
                       ALABAMA
         You did it, Quickdraw, I'm so
         proud of you. You were like a
         ninja. Did I do my part okay?
                       CLARENCE
         Babalouey, you were perfect, I
         could hardly keep from busting
         up.
                       ALABAMA
         I felt so stupid just blowing
         those bubbles.
                                                       80.

                       CLARENCE
         You were chillin', kind of creepy
         even. You totally fucked with
         his head. I'm gonna go grab
         dinner.
                       ALABAMA
         I'm gonna hop in the tub and get
         all wet, and slippery, and soapy.
         Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed,
         not even bother to dry off, and
         watch X-rated movies 'til you get
         your ass back to my lovin' arms.
They kiss.
                       CLARENCE
         We now return you to Bullitt
         already in progress.
He slams the MUSTANG in reverse and PEELS OUT of the
hotel. Alabama walks her little walk from the parking
lot to the pool area. Somebody WHISTLES at her, she
turns to them.
                       ALABAMA
         Thank you.
She gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens her
door.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY
She steps in only to find Virgil sitting in a chair
placed in front of the door with a sawed-off shotgun
aimed right at her.

                       VIRGIL
                (calmly)
         Step inside and shut the door.
She doesn't move, she's frozen.   Virgil leans forward.
                       VIRGIL
                (calmly)
         Lady, I'm gonna shoot you in the
         face.
She does exactly as he says.   Virgil rises, still aiming
the sawed-off.
                       VIRGIL
         Step away from the door, more
         into the room.
She does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then
steps closer to her.
                                                     81.

                       VIRGIL
         Okay, Alabama, where's our coke,
         where's Clarence, and when's he
         coming back.
                       ALABAMA
         I think you got the wrong room,
         my name is Sadie. I don't have
         any Coke, but there's a Pepsi
         machine downstairs. I don't know
         any Clarence, but maybe my husband
         does. You might have heard of him,
         he plays football. Al Lylezado.
         He'll be home any minute, you can
         ask him.
Virgil can't help but smile.

                        VIRGIL
         You're cute.
Virgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which
catches Alabama square in the face lifting her off of
the ground and dropping her flat on her back.

INT. RED MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY
Clarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat,
singing to himself.
                       CLARENCE
                (singing)
         'Land of stardust, land of glamour,
          Vistavision and Cinerama,
          everything about it is a must,
          to get to Hollywood, or bust...'


INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY
Alabama's lying flat. She actually blacked out for a
moment, but the salty taste of the blood in her mouth
woke her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil standing
there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream.
They open again to the same sight. She has never felt
more helpless in her life.
                       VIRGIL
         Hurts, don't it. You ain't hurt
         that bad. Get on our feet,
         Fruitloop.
Alabama wobbily complies.
                                                      82.

                       VIRGIL
         Where's our coke? Where's
         Clarence? And when's he comin'
         back?
Alabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without
a doubt she's going to die, because this man is going to
kill her.
                       ALABAMA
         Go take a flying fuck at a rolling
         donut.
Virgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a side kick
straight to the stomach. The air is sucked out of her
lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours
gasping for air that's just not there.

Virgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one
up with a Zippo lighter. He takes a long, deep drag.
                        VIRGIL
         Whatsamatta?   Can't breathe?   Get
         used to it.

INT. HAMBURGER STAND - DAY
Clarence walks through the door of some mom and pop
fast food restaurant.
                       CLARENCE
         Woah! Smells like hamburgers in
         here! What's the biggest, fatest
         hamburger you guys got?
The IRANIAN GUY at the counter says:

                       IRANIAN GUY
         That would be Steve's double
         chili cheeseburger.
                       CLARENCE
         Well I want two of them bad boys.
         Two large orders of chili fries.
         Two large diet Cokes.
                (looking at menu
                 on wall)
         And I'll tell you what, why don't
         you give me a combination burrito
         as well.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY
Alabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room.
She braces herself against the walls. She is very
punchy. Virgil steps in front of her.
                                                         83.

                       VIRGIL
         You think your boyfriend would go
         through this kind of shit for you?
         Dream on, cunt. You're nothin'
         but a fuckin' fool. And your
         pretty face is gonna turn awful
         goddamn ugly in about two seconds.
         Now where's my fuckin' coke?!
She doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse
kick, to the head. Her head slams into the left side
of the wall.
                       VIRGIL
         Where's Clarence?!
Nothing. He gives her another kick to the head. This
time from the other side. Her legs start to give way.
He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her
lightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.
                       VIRGIL
         When's Clarence getting back?
She can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages,
and she gives him the middle finger. Virgil can't help
but smile.
                       VIRGIL
         You gotta lot of heart, kid.
He gives her a spinning roundhouse kick to the head that
sends her to the floor.
INT. HAMBURGER STAND - CLOSEUP - BURGERS - DAY
SIZZLING on a GRIDDLE.     Chili and cheese are put on
them.

ANOTHER ANGLE
Clarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER
reading a copy of Newsweek with Elvis on the cover.
                        CLARENCE
         That's a great issue.
The Customer lowers his magazine a little bit.
                       CUSTOMER
         Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty
         decent one.
                       CLARENCE
         Have you read the story on Elvis.
                           SUBSCRIBER (CUSTOMER)
         No.    Not yet.
                                                     84.

                       CLARENCE
         You know, I saw it on the stands,
         my first inclination was to buy
         it. But, I look at the price and
         say forget it. It's just gonna be
         the same old shit. I ended up
         breaking down and buying it a few
         days later. Man, was I ever wrong.
                       SUBSCRIBER
         Liked it, huh?
                       CLARENCE
         It's probably the single best
         piece I've ever read about Elvis
         in my life.

                       SUBSCRIBER
         That good, huh?
He takes the magazine from the Subscriber's hands and
starts flipping to the Elvis article.
                       CLARENCE
         It tries to pin down what the
         attraction is after all these
         years. It covers the whole
         spectrum of fans, the people
         who love his music, the people
         who grew up with him, the artists
         he inspired; Bob Dylan, Bruce
         Springsteen, and the fanatics,
         like these guys. I don't know
         about you, but they give me the
         creeps.
                       SUBSCRIBER
         I can see what you mean.

                       CLARENCE
         Like look at her. She looks like
         she fell off of an ugly tree and
         hit every branch on the way down.
         Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat
         Boone's dick.
Clarence and the Subscriber laugh.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY
Alabama's pretty beat-up. She has a fat lip and her face
is black and blue. She's crawling around on the floor.
Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the cocaine.
He's also carrying on a running commentary.
                                                     85.

                       VIRGIL
         Now the first guy you kill is
         always the hardest. I don't care
         if you're the Boston Strangler or
         Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas
         boy, Charles Whitman, the fella
         who shot all them guys from that
         tower, I'll bet you green money
         that, that first little black dot
         that he took a bead on, was the
         bitch of the bunch. No foolin',
         the first one's a tough row to
         hoe. Now, the second one, while
         it ain't no Mardigra, it ain't
         half as tough as the first. You
         still feel somethin' but it's just
         so diluted this time around. Then
         you completely level off on the
         third one. The third one is easy.
         It's gotten to the point now
         I'll do it just to watch their
         expression change.
He's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he
flips the mattress up off the bed, and the black suitcase
is right there.
Alabama is crawling unnoticed to where her purse lay.
Virgil flips open the black case and almost goes
snowblind.
                       VIRGIL
         Well, well, well, looky here.
         I guess I just reached journey's
         end. Great. One less thing I
         gotta worry about.

Virgil closes up the case.   Alabama sifts through her
purse.
She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up, Virgil
turns toward her.
                       VIRGIL
         Okay, Sugarpop, we've come to
         what I like to call the moment
         of truth --
Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust out knife in
both hands. Mr. karate man smiles.
                       VIRGIL
         Kid, you gotta lot a heart.
He moves toward her.
Alabama's hands are shaking.
                                                      86.

                       VIRGIL
         Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm
         gonna give you a free swing. Now,
         I only do that for people I like.
He moves close.
Alabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his
shirt and rips it open. Buttons fly everywhere.
                       VIRGIL
         Go ahead, girl, take a stab at
         it.
                (giggling)
         You don't have anything to lose.


CLOSEUP - ALABAMA'S FACE
Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose.
Virgil's also right about this being the moment of
truth. There is a ferocity in women that comes out at
certain times, and it's just there under the surface in
many women all of the time. The absolute feeling of
helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one
hundred-eighty degree turn into "I'll take this mother-
fucker with me if it's the last thing I do" seething
hatred.
Letting out a blood-curdling yell, she raises the knife
high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges
it deep into Virgil's right foot.

CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE
Talk about blood curdling yells.

Alabama is kicked in the teeth with Virgil's left foot.
Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his
foot, tears running down his face.
While Virgil's bent down, Alabama SMASHES an Elvis
Presley whiskey DECANTER that Clarence bought her in
Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster so
it doesn't kill him.
Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.
                       VIRGIL
         Okay, no more mister nice-guy.
Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He
instinctively catches it, and with his arms full of
television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in his
nose, breaking it.
                                                     87.

Her eyes go straight to the door, then they go to the
sawed-off shotgun by the door. She runs to it, bends
over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks
her in the back sending her flying over the chair and
smashing into the door.
Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and
stands over Alabama. Alabama's lying on the ground
laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not a
one of them has ever laughed before he did it.
                       VIRGIL
         What's so funny?!!
                       ALABAMA
                (laughing)
         You look so ridiculous.

She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off
the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her
through the GLASS SHOWER DOOR in the bathroom.
                       VIRGIL
         Laugh it up, cunt. You were in
         hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't
         you laughing now.
Alabama laying in the bathtub grabs a small bottle of
hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand.
Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her
hair.
Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face.   He lets go of her
and his hands go to his eyes.
                       VIRGIL
         Oh Jesus!

She grabs a hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and
plunges it into his face.
                       VIRGIL
         Oh Mary, help me!
The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from
the shower. She's clutching a big, bloody piece of
broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of the Tasmanian
Devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees
the figure coming towards him. He lets out a wild
haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into
the toilet.
She recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain
lid off of the back of the toilet tank.
                                                       88.

Virgil whips out a .45 AUTOMATIC from his shoulder
holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head.
He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid
hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight
environment, but he FIRES anyway, hitting the floor,
the wall, the toilet, and the sink.
The toilet LID finally SHATTERS against Virgil's head.
Virgil falls to the ground.
Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big
can of Final Net hairspray, pulls a Bic lighter out of
her pocket, and just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she
flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through
the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits
Virgil right in the face.

He FIRES off TWO SHOTS. One which hits the wall, another
that hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying.
Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up,
knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom.
Virgil collapses onto the floor of the living room.
Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground. He
crawls toward it.
Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She
picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him. It's empty.
She's on her feet and into the room.
He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.
Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife.
She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back.
She hits him.

He arches up, FIRING the SAWED-OFF into the ceiling,
dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and
stucco all over the room.
Alabama snatches the shotgun.
Arched over on his back Virgil's eyes make contact with
Alabama's eyes.
The FIRST BLAST hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing
his arm off. The SECOND hits him in the knee. The
THIRD plays hell with his chest.
Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with
the butt of the shotgun.
Ever since she's been firing it's as if some other part
of her brain has been functioning independently. She's
been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis.
                                                    89.

                       ALABAMA
         'Lord make me an instrument of
            they peace,
          where there is hatred, let me
            love,
          where there is despair -- hope,
          where there is darkness -- light,
          where there is sadness -- joy,
          oh, divine master, grant that I
          may not seek to be consoled --
            but to console,
          that I may not seek to be
            understood --
          but to understand,
          and it is in dying that we are
            born to eternal life.'

Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the
door, gun drawn, only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy
on the head, with a shotgun.
                         CLARENCE
         Honey?
She continues.    He puts his gun away.
                       CLARENCE
         Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be
         here any minute.
She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she
falls to the ground. She lays on the floor trembling,
still continuing with the downward swings of her arms.
Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses
Alabama over his shoulder.
                                          CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY
Everybody is outside of their rooms watching as Clarence
walks through the pool area with his bundle. SIRENS can
be heard APPROACHING.

EXT. RED MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY
Clarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in
the passenger seat. She's muttering to herself.
Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the
other stroking Alabama's hair.
                       CLARENCE
         Sleep, baby. Don't dream. Don't
         worry. Just sleep. You deserve
         better than this. I'm so sorry.
         Sleep, my angel. Sleep peacefully.

EXT. MOTEL 6 - NIGHT
A new motel.   Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside.

INT. MOTEL 6 - CLARENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
Alabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is
asleep in bed.

INT. NOWHERE - ?
Clarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly TO
CAMERA. He's in a HEADSHOT.


                       CLARENCE
         I feel so horrible about what
         she went through. That fucker
         really beat the shit out of her.
         She never told him where I was.
         It's like I always felt that the
         way she felt about me was a
         mistake. She couldn't really
         care that much. I always felt in
         the back of my mind, I don't know,
         she was joking. But, to go
         through that and remain loyal,
         it's very easy to be enraptured
         with words, but to remain loyal
         when it's easier, even excusable,
         not to -- that's a test of one's
         self. That's true romance. I
         swear to God, I'll cut off my
         hands and gouge out my eyes before
         I'll ever let anything happen to
         that lady again.

A wonderful, gracefully flowing SHOT of the Hollywood
hills. Off in the distance we hear the ROAR of a CAR

A blonde, glitzy COKE WHORE is sitting next to him.
They're having a ball. Then they see a red and blue
light flashing in the rear-view mirror. It's the cops.
                       ELLIOT
         Fuck! I knew it! I knew it!
         I fucking knew it! I should
         have my head examined driving
         like this!
                (pulls over)
         Kandi, you gotta help me.
                       KANDI (COKE WHORE)
         What can I do?
He pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence
gave him earlier.

                       ELLIOT
         You gotta hold this for me.
                       KANDI
         You must be high. Uh-uh.     No way.
                       ELLIOT
                (frantically)
         Just put it in your purse!
                       KANDI
         I'm not gonna put that shit in
         my purse.
                       ELLIOT
         They won't search you, I promise.
         You haven't done anything.
                         KANDI
         No way, Jose.

                       ELLIOT
         Please, they'll be here any
         minute. Just put it in your bra.
                       KANDI
         I'm not wearing a bra.
                       ELLIOT
                (pleading)
         Put it in your pants.
                         KANDI
         No.
                       ELLIOT
         You're the one who wanted to drive
         fast.
                                                    92.

                         KANDI
         Read my lips.
She mouths the word "no."
                       ELLIOT
         After all I've done for you, you
         fucking whore!!
She goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine
instead, it rips open. Cocaine completely covers his
blue suit, at that moment Elliot turns to face a flash-
light beam. Tears fill his eyes.

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Elliot is sitting in a chair at a table. Two young,
good-looking, casually-dressed Starsky and Hutch type
police detectives are questioning him. They're known
in the department as NICHOLSON and DIMES. The dark-
haired one is Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky
Dimes.
                       NICHOLSON
         Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich
         bag of uncut cocaine --
                       DIMES
         Not a tiny little vial --
                       NICHOLSON
         But a fuckin' Baggie.
                       DIMES
         Now don't sit there and feed us
         some shit.

                       NICHOLSON
         You got caught. It's all fun and
         fuckin' games till you get caught.
         But now we gottcha. Okay, mister
         Elliot actor, you've just made the
         big time --
                       DIMES
         You're no longer an extra --
                       NICHOLSON
         Or a bit player --
                       DIMES
         Or a supporting actor --
                       NICHOLSON
         You're a fuckin' star!
                       (MORE)
                                                       93.

                       NICHOLSON (CONT'D)
         And you're gonna be playin' your
         little one man show nightly for
         the next two fucking years for a
         captive audience --
                       DIMES
         But there is a bright side though.
         If you ever have to play a part of
         a guy who gets fucked in his ass
         on a daily basis by throat-slitting
         niggers, you'll have so much
         experience to draw on --
                       NICHOLSON
         And just think, when you get out
         in a few years, you'll meet some
         girl, get married, and you'll be
         so understanding to your wife's
         needs, because you'll know what
         it's like to be a woman --
                       DIMES
         'Course you'll wanna fuck her in
         the ass. Pussy just won't feel
         right anymore --
                       NICHOLSON
         That is, of course, if you don't
         catch A.I.D.S. from all your
         anal intrusions.
Elliot starts crying. Nicholson and Dimes exchange
looks and smiles. Mission accomplished.

INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN KRINKLE'S OFFICE - DAY

CAPTAIN BUFFORD KRINKLE is sitting behind his desk, where
he spends about seveny-five percent of his days. He's
your standard rough, gruff, no-nonsense, by-the-book type
police captain.
                        KRINKLE
         Nicolson!   Dimes! Get in here!
The two casually-dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in.
         NICHOLSON                      DIMES
 Krinkle, this is it. We        Krinkle, you're lookin'
 got it, man. And it's all      at the two future cops
 ours. I mean talk about        of the month. We have
 fallin' into somethin'.        it, and when I say we,
 You shoulda seen it, it        I don't mean me and him,

         NICHOLSON (CONT'D)             DIMES (CONT'D)
 Dimes is hittin' him from      Haven't had a decent bust
 the left about being fucked    this whole month. Well,
 in the ass by niggers, I'm     we mighta come in like a
 hittin' him from the right     lamb, but we're goin' out
 about not likin' pussy         like a lion --
 anymore, finally he just
 starts cryin', and then it
 was all over --
                       KRINKLE
         Both you idiots shut up, I can't
         understand shit! Now, what's
         happened, what's going on, and
         what are you talkin' about?
                       DIMES
         Okee dokee. It's like this,
         Krinkle; a patrol car stops this
         dork for speeding, they walk up
         to the window and the guy's
         covered in coke. So they bring
         his ass in and me an' Nicholson
         go to work on him --
                       NICHOLSON
         Nicholson and I.
                       DIMES
         Nicholson and I go to work on
         him. Now we know something's
         rotten in Denmark, 'cause this
         dickhead had a big bag, and it's
         uncut too, so we're sweatin'
         him, tryin' to find out where
         he got it. Scarin' the shit
         outta him --

                       NICHOLSON
         Which wasn't real hard, the guy
         was a real squid.
                       DIMES
         So we got this guy scared shitless
         and he starts talkin'. And,
         Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin'
         believe it.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
Detroit. Very fancy restaurant. Four wise guys,
FRANKIE, LENNY, DARIO and MARVIN, are seated at a table
with Mr. Coccotti.
                                              95.

                       COCCOTTI
         -- And so, tomorrow morning comes,
         and no Virgil. I check with Nick
         Cardella, who Virgil was supposed
         to leave my narcotics with, he
         never shows. Now, children,
         somebody is stickin' a red hot
         poker up my asshole and what I
         don't know is whose hand's on the
         handle.
                       FRANKIE
         You think Virgil started gettin'
         big ideas?
                       COCCOTTI
         It's possible. Anybody can be
         carried away with delussions of
         grandure. But after that incident
         in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil.
                        DARIO
         What happen?
                       LENNY
         Virgil got picked up in a
         warehouse shakedown. He got
         five years, he served three.
                       COCCOTTI
         Anybody who clams up and does his
         time, I don't care how I feel
         about him personally, he's okay.

BACK TO KRINKLE
                       NICHOLSON
         It seems a cop from some
         department, we don't know where,
         stole a half a million dollars
         of coke from the property cage
         and he's been sittin' on it for
         a year and a half. Now the cops
         got this weirdo --
                       DIMES
         Suspect's words --
                       NICHOLSON
         -- to front for him. So Elliot is
         workin' out a deal between them
         and his boss, a big movie
         producer named Lee Donowitz.
                       DIMES
         He produced 'Comin' Home in a
         Body Bag.'
                                                   96.

                       KRINKLE
         That Vietnam movie?
                      NICHOLSON
         Uh-huh.
                       KRINKLE
         That was a good fuckin' movie.
                      DIMES
         Sure was.
                       KRINKLE
         Do you believe him?
                       NICHOLSON
         I believe he believes him.

                       DIMES
         He's so spooked he'd turn over his
         momma, his daddy, his two-panny
         granny, and Anna and the King of
         Siam if he had anything on him.
                       NICHOLSON
         This rabbit'll do anything not to
         do time, including wearing a wire.
                       KRINKLE
         He'll wear a wire?
                       DIMES
         We talked him into it.
                       KRINKLE

         Look, we don't care if you bring in
         the state militia, the volunteer
         fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds,
         the ghost of Steve McQueen, and twelve
         Roman gladiators, so long as we get
         credit for the bust.

         Cardella turns Virgil's switch to
         off, and Cardella decides to open
         up his own fruit stand.
                       LENNY
         Excuse me, Mister Coccotti,
                (to Marvin)
         Do you know Nick Cardella?
                         MARVIN
         No.
                       LENNY
         Then where the hell do you get
         off talkin' that kind of talk --?

                       MARVIN
         I didn't mean --
                       LENNY
         Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella
         was provin' what his word was
         worth before you were in your
         daddy's nutsack. What sun do
         you walk under you can throw a
         shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick
         Cardella's a stand up guy.
                       COCCOTTI
         Children, we're digressing.
         Another possibility is that rat
         fuck whore and her wack-a-doo
         cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil.
         Knowing Virgil, I find that hard
         to believe. But they sent Drexl
         to hell, and Drexl was no faggot.
         So you see, children, I got a lot
         of questions and no answers. Find
         out who this wing and prayer
         artist is and take him off at the
         neck.
TITLE CARD:    "THE BIG DAY"

EXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY - SUNRISE
Clarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just
off of Imperial Highway. As luck would have it, some-
body has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of the
road. Clarence and Alabama sit on the sofa, sharing a
Jumbo Java, and enjoying the sunrise and wonderful view
of the LAX Airport runways, where planes are taking off
and landing. A PLANE TAKES OFF, and they stop and watch.

                       CLARENCE
         Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate
         airports.
                       ALABAMA
         Really?
                       CLARENCE
         With a vengeance, I hated them.
                       ALABAMA
         How come?
                       CLARENCE
         I used to live by one back in
         Dearborn. It's real frustrating
         to be surrounded by airplanes
         when you ain't got shit. I hated
         where I was, but I couldn't do
         anything about it. I didn't have
         any money. It was tough enough
         just tryin' to pay my rent every
         month, and here I was livin' next
         to a airport. Whenever I went
         outside, I saw fuckin' planes
         takin' off. I'm tryin' to watch
         TV, fuckin' planes takin' off
         drownin' out my show. All day
         long I'm seein', hearin' people
         doin' what I wanted to do most,
         but couldn't.
                       ALABAMA
         Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on
         vacations, startin' new lives,
         business trips. Fun, fun, fun,
         fun.

Another PLANE TAKES OFF.
                       CLARENCE
         But knowin' me and you gonna be
         nigger rich gives me a whole new
         outlook. I love airports now.
         Me 'n you can get on any one of
         those planes out there, and go
         anywhere we want.
                       ALABAMA
         You ain't kiddin, we got lives to
         start over. We should go
         somewhere where we can really
         start from scratch.

                        CLARENCE
          I been in America all my life.
          I'm due for a change. I wanna
          see what TV in other countries
          are like. Besides, it's more
          dramatic. Where should we fly
          off to, my little turtle dove?
                        ALABAMA
          Cancun
                        CLARENCE
          Why Cancun?
                        ALABAMA
          It's got a nice ring to it. It
          sounds like a movie, 'Clarence
          and Alabama go to Cancun'.
          Doncha think?
                        CLARENCE
          But in my movie, baby, you get top
          billing.
They kiss.
                        CLARENCE
          Don't you worry 'bout anything.
          It's all gonna work out for us.
          We deserve it.

MONTAGE
Everyone gets ready for the big day.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY

Dick, Clarence and Alabama are just getting ready to
leave for the drug deal. Floyd lies on the couch
watching TV. Alabama's wearing dark glasses to hide
some of the damage caused by Virgil.
                        CLARENCE
                 (to Floyd)
          You sure that's how you get to the
          Beverly Wilshire?
                        FLOYD
          I've partied there twice.    Yeah,
          I'm sure.
                                                    100.

                       DICK
         Yeah, well, if we get lost, it's
         your ass.
                (to Clarence)
         Come on, Clarence, let's go.
         Elliot's going to meet us in
         the lobby.
                       CLARENCE
         I'm just making sure we got
         everything.
                (to Alabama)
         You got yours?
She holds up the suitcase. The PHONE RINGS.   The three
pile out the door. Floyd answers the phone.

                         FLOYD
         Hello?
                (puts his hand
                 over the receiver)
         Dick, it's for you. You here?
                         DICK
         No.   I left.
He starts to close the door, then opens it again.
                       DICK
         I'll take it.
                (takes the receiver)
         Hello.
                (pause)
         Hi, Catherine, I was just walkin'
         out the --
                (pause)
         Really?
                (pause)
         I don't believe it.
                (pause)
         She really said that?
                (pause)
         I'll be by first thing.
                (pause)
         No. Thank you for sending me out.
                (pause)
         'Bye-bye.
He hangs up and looks at Clarence.
                       DICK
                (stunned)
         I got the part on 'T.J. Hooker.'
                        CLARENCE
         No shit?   Dick, that's great!
                                                         101.

Clarence and Alabama are jumping around.    Floyd even
smiles.
                       DICK
                (still stunned)
         They didn't even want a callback.
         They just hired me like that. Me
         and Peter Breck are the two
         heavies. We start shooting
         Monday. My call is for seven
         o'clock in the morning.
                       CLARENCE
         Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in
         the car. We can't be late.
Dick looks at Clarence.    He doesn't want to go.

                          DICK
         Clarence.
                          CLARENCE
         Yeah?
                          DICK
         Um, nothing.     Let's go.
They exit.

INT. HOTEL/LAX - ROOM - DAY
Lenny can be seen putting a shotgun together.    He is
sitting on a bed.
Toothpick Vic ENTERS the FRAME with his own shotgun.      He
goes over to Lenny and gives him some shells.
Marvin walks THROUGH the FRAME cocking his own shotgun.
The bathroom door opens behind Lenny and Frankie walks

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
A room at the Beverly Wilshire. Nicholson and Dimes and
four DETECTIVES from Internal Affairs are in a room on
the same floor as Donowitz. They have just put a wire
on Elliot.
                       NICHOLSON
         Okay, say something.

         Are you getting this shit?
The IA Officer at the tape machine gives a thumbs up.
Nicholson, Dimes, and WURLITZER huddle by Elliot.
                       DIMES
         Now, remeber, we'll be monitoring
         just down the hall.
                       ELLIOT
         And if there's any sign of trouble
         you'll come in.
                       NICHOLSON
         Like gangbusters. Now remember, if
         you don't want to go to jail, we
         gotta put your boss in jail.
                       DIMES
         We have to show in court that,
         without a doubt, a successful man,
         an important figure in the
         Hollywood community, is also
         dealing cocaine.

         So you gotta get him to admit on
         tape that he's buying this coke.

         You got that playing basketball?

                       ALABAMA
         Yeah. I got elbowed right in the
         eye. And if that wasn't enough,
         I got hurled the ball when I'm not
         looking. Wham! Right in my

They stop at a red light.   Clarence looks to Alabama.

         I'll take that. Now remember,
         both of you, let me do the
         talking.
Clarence takes out a .45.   Dick reacts.   They walk and
talk.

         What the fuck did you bring that
         for?

          In case they try to kill us. I
          don't know. What do you want me
          to say?
                        DICK
          Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is
          not a pimp --
                        CLARENCE
          I know that, Richard. I don't
          think I'll need it. But something
          this last week has taught me, it's
          better to have a gun and not need
          it than to need a gun and not have
          it.
Pause.   Clarence stops walking.
                        CLARENCE
          Hold it, guys. I don't know about
          the rest of you, but I'm pretty
          scared. What say we forget the
          whole thing?
Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.
                        DICK
          Do you really mean it?
                        CLARENCE
          No. I don't really mean it.
          Well, I mean this is our last
          chance to think about it. How
          'bout you, 'Bama?
                        ALABAMA
          I thought it was what you wanted,
          Clarence.
                        CLARENCE
          It is what I want. But I don't
          want to spend the next ten years
          in jail. I don't want you guys
          to go to jail. We don't know
          what could be waiting for us up
          there. It'll probably be just
          what it's supposed to be. The
          only thing that's waiting for us
          is two hundred thousand dollars.
          I'm just looking at the downside.

         Now's a helluva time to play
         'what if.'
                       CLARENCE
         This is our last chance to play
         'what if.' I don't want to do
         it. I'm just scared of getting
         caught.
                       ALABAMA
         It's been fun thinking about the
         money, but I can walk away from
         it, honey.
                        CLARENCE
         That rhymes.

He kisses her.

         Well, if we're not gonna do it,
         let's just get in the car and
         get the fuck outta here.
                       CLARENCE
         Yeah, let's just get outta here.
The three walk back to the car. Clarence gets behind
the wheel. The other two get in. Clarence hops back
out.
                       CLARENCE
         I'm sorry, guys. I gotta do it.
         As petrified as I am, I just
         can't walk away. I'm gonna be
         kicking myself in the ass the
         rest of my life if I don't go
         in there. Lee Donowitz isn't a
         gangster lookin' to skin us and
         he's not a cop, he's a famous
         movie producer lookin' to get
         high. And I'm just the man who
         can get him there. So what say
         we throw caution to the wind and
         let the chips fall where they
         may.
Clarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the
hotel. Dick and Alabama exchange looks and follow.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LOBBY - DAY
Elliot's walking around the lobby.    He's very nervous.
Clarence enters the lobby alone, carrying the suitcase.
                                                       106.

He spots Elliot and goes in his direction. Elliot sees
Clarence approaching him. He says to himself quietly:
                       ELLIOT
         Elliot, your motivation is to
         stay out of jail.
Clarence walks up to Elliot, they shake hands.
                       ELLIOT
         Where's everybody else?
                       CLARENCE
         They'll be along.
Alabama and Dick enter the lobby and join up with
Clarence and Elliot.

                       ELLIOT
         Hi, Dick.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Nicholson, Dimes and the other detectives are surrounding
the tape machine. Coming from the machine is Elliot and
Clarence's conversation.
                       DICK (V.O.)
         How you doin', Elliot?
                       CLARENCE (V.O.)
         Well, I guess it's about that
         time.
                        ELLIOT (V.O.)
         I guess so.   Follow me.


INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY
The four of them are riding up in the elevator. As
luck would have it, they have the car to themselves.
Rinky dinky elevator MUZAK is playing. They are all
silent. Clarence breaks the silence.
                       CLARENCE
         Elliot.

         Get on your knees.
Not sure he's heard him right.

                       ELLIOT
         What?
Clarence hits the stop button on the elevator panel
and whips out the .45.
                       CLARENCE
         I said, get on your fuckin'
         knees!
Elliot does it immediately.    Dick and Alabama react.

Elliot does.   The .45 is still pressed against his
forehead.
                       CLARENCE
         Like Nick Carter used to say: if
         I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want
         you to tell us what's waitin' for
         us. Up there. Something's amiss,
         I can feel it. If anything out of
         the ordinary goes down, believe

         Don't blow it, Elliot. He's

         himself.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY
Elliot still hasn't answered.
                        CLARENCE
         Okay.
With the .45 up against Elliot's head, Clarence puts
his palm over the top of the gun to shield himself from
the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what
he's gonna do.
Elliot, tears running down his face, starts talking
for the benefit of the people at the other end of the
wire. He sounds like a little boy.
                       ELLIOT
         I don't wanna be here. I wanna go
         home. I wish somebody would just
         come and get me 'cause I don't
         like this. This is not what I
         thought it would be. And I wish
         somebody would just come and take
         me away. Just take me away. Come
         and get me. 'Cause I don't like
         this anymore. I can't take this.

Nicholson and Dimes shake their heads. They have a
"well, that's that" expression on their faces.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY
Clarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot.

                       CLARENCE
         Sorry, Elliot. Nothing personal.
         I just hadda make sure you're
         alright. I'm sure. I really
         apologize for scaring you so bad
         but, believe me, I'm just as scared
         as you. Friends?
Elliot, in a state of shock, takes Clarence's hand.
Dick and Alabama are relieved.

moved since we last saw him.
There is a KNOCK on the door.

                 from the TV)
         It's open.
The door flings open and the four wiseguys rapidly enter
the room. The door slams shut. All have their sawed-
offs drawn and pointed at Floyd.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S ROOM - DAY
Clarence knocks on the door.
The door opens and reveals an extremely muscular guy
with an Uzi strapped to his shoulder standing in the
doorway. His name is MONTY.
                        MONTY
         Hi, Elliot.   Are these your
         friends?
                       ELLIOT
         You could say that. Everybody,
         this is Monty.

                       MONTY
         C'mon in. Lee's in the can.
         He'll be out in a quick.
They all move into the room, it is very luxurious.
Another incredibly muscular guy, BORIS, is sitting on
the sofa. He, too, has an Uzi.
Monty begins patting everyone down.
                       MONTY
         Sorry, nothing personal.
He starts to search Clarence.    Clarence backs away.
                       CLARENCE
         No need to search me, daredevil.
         All you'll find is a .45 caliber
         automatic.

Boris gets up from the couch.
                       BORIS
         What compelled you to bring that
         along?
                       CLARENCE
         The same thing that compelled you,
         Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire
         weaponry to a business meeting.
                       BORIS
         I'll take that.

         You'll have to.

The TOILET FLUSHES in the bathroom.    The door swings
open and Lee Donowitz emerges.

         Really?
                       CLARENCE
         Well, I have to admit, walkin'
         through the door and seein' those
         Soldier of Fortune poster boys
         made me a bit nervous. But, Lee,
         I'm fairly confident that you came
         here to do business, not to be a
         wiseguy. So, if you want, I'll
         put my gun on the table.
                       LEE
         I don't think that will be
         necessary. Let's all have a seat.
         Boris, why don't you be nice and
         get coffee for everybody.
They all sit around a fancy glass table except for
Boris, who's getting the coffee, and Monty, who
stands behind Lee's chair.

                       CLARENCE
         Okay, sorry, Lee. I just wanna
         tell you that Coming Home in a
         Body Bag is one of my favorite
         movies. After Apocalypse Now,
         I think it's the best Vietnam
         movie ever.
                       LEE
         Thank you very much, Clarence.
                       CLARENCE
         You know, most movies that win a
         lot of Oscars, I can't stand.
         Sophie's Choice, Ordinary People,
         Kramer vs. Kramer, Gandhi. All
         that stuff is safe, geriatric,
         coffee table, dog shit.
                       LEE
         I hear you talking, Clarence. We
         park our cars in the same garage.
                       CLARENCE
         Like that Merchant Ivory claptrap.
         All those assholes make are
         unwatchable movies from unreadable
         books.
Boris starts placing clear glass coffee cups in front of
everybody and fills everyone's cup from a fancy coffee-
pot that he handles like an expert.
                       LEE
         Clarence, there might be somebody
         somewhere that agrees with you
         more than I do, but I wouldn't
         count on it.
Clarence is on a roll and he knows it.

         They aren't plays, they're not
         books, they certainly ain't
         movies, they're films. And do
         you know what films are? They're
         for people who don't like movies.
         Mad Max, that's a movie. The
         Good, the Bad and the Ugly,
         that's a movie. Rio Bravo, that's
         a movie. Rumblefish, that's a
         fuckin' movie. And Coming Home

         Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris,
         could I have some more coffee?
                       CLARENCE
         Me, too, Boris.
Boris fills both their cups. They both, calm as a lake,
take cream and sugar. All eyes are on them. Lee uses
light cream and sugar, he begins stirring his cup.
Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar.
                       LEE
                (stirring loudly)
         You like a little coffee with
         your cream and sugar?
                       CLARENCE
         I'm not saitsfied till the spoon
         stands straight up.
Both are cool as cucumbers.
                       LEE
         I have to hand it to you, this is
         not nose garbage. This is
         quality. Can Boris make anybody
         a sandwich?

         I got all kinds of sandwich shit
         from Canter's in there.
                       ALABAMA
         No, thank you.
                         DICK
         No.    But thanks.
                         CLARENCE
         No thanks.
Lee continues looking at the merchandise. Alabama writes
something on her napkin with a pencil and slides the
napkin over to Clarence. It says: "You're so cool" with
a tiny heart drawn on the bottom of it. Clarence takes
a pencil and draws an arrow through the heart. She takes
the napkin and puts it in her pocket.
Lee looks up.
                       LEE
         Okay, Clarence, the merchandise is
         perfect. But, whenever I'm
         offered a deal that's too good to
         be true, it's because it's a lie.
         Convince me you're on the level.

         Well, Lee, it's like this. You're
         getting the bargain of a lifetime
         because I don't know what the fuck
         I'm doing. You're used to dealin'
         with professionals. I'm not a
         professional. I'm a rank amateur.
         I could take that and I could cut
         it and I could sell it a little
         bit at a time and make a helluva
         lot more money. But, in order to
         do that, I'd have to become a drug
         dealer. I'm not a drug dealer.

         just saw his chance and he took

This is a Mexican standoff, if ever there was one.
Gangsters at one end, with shotguns. Bodyguards at

Dick's ready to pass out.
Alabama's so scared she's peed on herself.      She places

Lee can't control his anger anymore. He grabs the

Alabama screams.
Clarences staggers backwards into the bathroom and
falls onto the floor.
It might have been a stand-off before, but, once the
firing started, everybody's either hitting the ground

Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA officer and

With BULLETS flying this way and that, some didn't have
time to do anything. Two IA officers were hit straight

Vic takes an UZI HIT and goes down FIRING.
Elliot gets it from both sides.
Alabama is crawling across the floor like a soldier in

Marvin brings his SAWED-OFF up from behind the sofa

Dick runs into the elevator area.    He hits the buttons.
He's trapped, it's like a box.
Lenny catches up. Dick raises his hands.    Lenny aims

                       DIMES
         Now come out with your hands
         raised!
                                                       126.

                        MARVIN
                 (from behind
                  the couch)
         No!
Dimes and Wurlitzer exchange glances and then look back
at the couch.
                       DIMES
         Why the fuck not!?
                       MARVIN
         'Cause you're gonna shoot me!
                       WURLITZER
         Come out from behind the couch!

                         DIMES
         Now!
                       BORIS
         I need an ambulance!
                       WURLITZER
         Shut the fuck up!
                       BORIS
         I need a fucking ambulance!
                         WURLITZER
         Would you --
Suddenly, Marvin jumps up from behind the couch with a
snub-nose REVOLVER. He BLASTS off THREE SHOTS.
                       DIMES
         That dumb fuck!

Then Dimes notices the blood in Wurlitzer's stomach.
Wurlitzer drops his gun.
                        WURLITZER
         Oh damn.   Looks like I took one.
Wurlitzer sits down in the shot-up couch.
                         WURLITZER
         Damn.
Dimes leans next to Wurlitzer.
                       DIMES
         It's not that bad, it's not that
         bad... I'll call for an ambulance.
But Wurlitzer is dead.
                                                     127. ***

                        DIMES
                 (frustrated)
         Shit.
He looks around at the battle zone. The room is torn
apart. Nicholson's headless body is covered with
coke from the suitcase. Dead bodies are everywhere.
                       BORIS
         I need an ambulance.
                       DIMES
         Fuck you!
                        BORIS
         Fuck you!   I'm bleeding here!

Dimes EMPTIES his CLIP into Boris until it's clear
Boris isn't going to be needing much of anything.
                       DIMES
         That was for Cody, you sack a
         shit.
Then a BULLET cuts through Dimes' solar plexus. A shot
that came from behind. A shot that came from Alabama.
Dimes collapses to the ground.
Alabama is holding Clarence against her. He looks
practically unconscious. Alabama has that fire in her
eyes of a mother lion defending her young. All she
wants, and all she cares about is the man leaning
against her.
She drops the gun to the ground.
                       ALABAMA
                (tenderly to Clarence)
         C'mon, sweety, we've got to get
         out of here.
They start to hobble out, then Alabama sees something...
the suitcase full of money.
She looks around the carnage of the room, then down at
the suitcase.
And with Clarence under one arm and the suitcase
gripped tightly in the other, she walks out of the room.
                                           CUT TO:

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LOBBY - DAY
Lenny is holding a woman hostage with the shotgun held
to her head.
                                                       128.

Fifteen COPS, all with their guns aimed at Lenny, are
trying to talk him out of it.
The lobby is a scene of total chaos.
                       COP #1
         It doesn't have to be this way,
         son!
                       LENNY
                (yelling)
         Fuck you! I'll blow this bitch's
         brains to kingdom come!
                       COP #2
         Put the gun down!

                       LENNY
         I said fuck you! I want a car
         here, takin' me to the airport,
         with a plane full o' gas... and
         a million bucks!
                (pauses)
         Small bills.
At another part of the lobby the elevator doors open
up. Clarence and Alabama hobble out.
Amid all the chaos nobody (miraculously) notices...
or cares to notice... Clarence and Alabama as they
slowly walk out.
Just before they're out of the building the police
OPEN FIRE on Lenny and yank the woman away from him.
People scream.
Alabama and Clarence slip out the door and into the
parking lot.


EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - PARKING LOT - DAY
As they pass the police cars and firetrucks, amid all
the chaos, we hear Alabama's voice:
                       ALABAMA (V.O.)
         Sometimes I'm asked by Clarence
         what I was thinking as we walked
         a suitcase full of cash under the
         noses of a hundred cops.
Alabama and the delirious Clarence get into the red
Mustang. With Alabama at the wheel they drive away.
                                                      129.

                       ALABAMA (V.O.)
         I smile and play coy with him and
         have never yet told him what was
         going through my mind.

INT. RED MUSTANG (CALIFORNIA COAST) - MOVING - DAY
Clarence is sleeping with his head in Alabama's lap.
His face is covered with bandages. She drives, pensively
thinking to herself.
                       ALABAMA (V.O.)
         Amid the chaos of that day, when
         all I could hear was the thunder
         of gunshots, and all I could smell
         was the violence in the air, I
         look back and am amazed that my
         thoughts were so clear and true.
         That three words went through my
         mind endlessly. Repeating
         themselves like a broken record.
They pass through the Tijuana border gate.
                       ALABAMA (V.O.)
         You're so cool. You're so cool.
         You're so cool.

EXT. MEXICO BEACH - DAY
A little boy with nappy black hair and striking blue
eyes runs into his mother's arms. His mother is Alabama.
Next to her is Clarence, wearing an eyepatch. They pick
the little boy up and walk down the beach, their pants
rolled up, the water lapping at their feet, and the warm
wind blowing in their hair.
                       ALABAMA (V.O.)
         And sometimes Clarence asks me
         what I would have done if he had
         died. If that bullet had been
         two inches more to the left. To
         this I always smile as if I'm not
         going to satisfy him with a
         response. But I always do.

              ALABAMA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I tell him of how I would want to
die, but that the anguish and
want of death would fade like the
stars at dawn. And that things
would be much as they are now.
Perhaps. Except, maybe, I wouldn't
have named our son... Elvis.

                                FADE TO BLACK.
