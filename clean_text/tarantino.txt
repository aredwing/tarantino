FADE IN:

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY
As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.
The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).
One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.
As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
skin off ankles.
AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
Greenville Auction.

DJANGO
Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.
He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
unknown, never to be seen again.
As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;
DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
for forty.
WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
structure.
The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
of the auction block.

DJANGO
is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
(their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
the block.
A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

DJANGO
takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.
It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
buy Niggers, who look up to him.
His heart fills with poison.

BACK TO DJANGO
walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the
blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.

THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
end.

/--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT
It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
their black skinned cargo forward.
It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
seven chained together Slaves, with the soad one holding a lantern, and
all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
resemble a human locomotive.
The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
fur collars.

WHEN...
.A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
rifles for possible trouble.

A BLACK HORSE
carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.

THE RIDER
appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
hat on his head.

DICKY SPECK
Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
State your business, or prepare to get
winged!

THE RIDER
Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

THE RIDER
(to the Slavers)
Good cold evening gentlemen.
(to the shivering Slaves)
Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
slave traders that go by the'name of
The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

ACE SPECK
Who wants to. know?

THE RIDER
I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
is my horse, Fritz.
Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
him.

DICKY SPECK
You a doctor?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Affirmative.

DICKY SPECK
What kinda doctor?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

ACE SPECK
So what?

Dr.SCHULTZ
So, I wish to parley with you.

ACE SPECK
Speak English!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
second language. Amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe, is a specimen
I'm keen to acquire.
(to the slaves)
Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
you, who was formerly a resident of
The Carrucan Plantation?
Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
VOICE rings out;

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
lantern, illuminating our hero Django.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

DJANGO
Django.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
amazing name - during your time at the
Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
three overseers by the name of The Brittle
Brothers?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz is delighted.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

DJANGO
Dem da Brittle Brothers.

Dr.SCHULTZ
So Django, do you think you could recognize -
. The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.

ACE SPECK
Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Like what?

ACE SPEC
Like that!

Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

ACE SPECK
Speak English, goddamit!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

ACE SPECK
I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
sale.
Ace raises his rifle towards the German.

ACE SPECK
Move it!
Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.

Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, did you simply get carried away
with your dramatic gesture, or are you
pointing that weapon at me with lethal
intention...?

ACE SPECK
Last chance, fancy pants

Dr.SCHULTZ
- Very well -
The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
darkness.
The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
.BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.
Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
direction...

BAM...

Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
.The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
white man before.
Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
But I didn't want you to do anything rash
before you had a moment to come to your senses.
Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
Dicky's body.

DICKY SPECK
You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!

Dr.SCHULTZ.
I only shot your brother, once he threatened
to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...

(COUNTING OUT

THE SLAVES)
.one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

DICKY SPECK
My damn legs busted!

Dr.SCHULTZ
No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

(TO DJANGO)
As I was saying, if you were to see
the Brittle Brothers again, would you
recognize them?

DJANGO
Yes.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
unshaven white men, can you honestly
and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I can point 'em out.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
Django?

DICKY SPECK
I'm gonna lose this leg!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, unless you find a talented physician
very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
end result. But back to business, how much
do you want for Django?

DICKY SPECK
You go to hell!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be silly. How much for Django?

DICKY SPECK
800 dollars!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
the slave trade that you and your family does,
but neither was I born yesterday.
The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.

Dr.SCHULTZ
In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
that the going rate for African flesh'
- in particularly a field nigger - is sixty
to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
why would they lie - puts his price at
eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
young Django here.
Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.

Dr.SCHULTZ
And since your late brother. won't be using
it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
Django is free.

Dr.SCHULTZ
There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
rubbing, then get up on that horse.
Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
bill of sale. Do you have one?
Dicky just curses him.
He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;

Dr.SCHULTZ
I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
(as he writes)
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
(he stops, then
says to Django)
Django is spelled with a silent "D",
is it not?

DJANGO
Huh?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not..
He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
way it looks.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that does add a little character.
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.

Dr.SCHULTZ
If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
mark here.
The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
He signs the bill of sale.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
pleasure doing business with you, but your
customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
leg irons.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Now as to you poor devils.
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.

Dr.SCHULTZ
So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
to the nearest town. Which would be at least
thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
Or ...
.Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep, and make your way
to a more enlightened area of the country.
The choice is yours.
He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, and on the off chance that there's
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Just give him a little kick.
Django does, and the horse responds by moving.

Dr.SCHULTZ
See, it's not so difficult.

EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.

Dr.SCHULTZ
So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

DJANGO
Who?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Your horse?

DJANGO
What horse?

Dr.SCHULTZ'
The horse you're riding.

DJANGO
This ain't my horse.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is.

DJANGO
No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
it.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
technically not. If it's my horse, I can
give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
congratulations.

DJANGO
I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
up in no stable.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRUSTRATED)
Don't worry about all that!
They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
then says with a smile;

Dr.SCHULTZ
So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
intend to name it? Half the fun of having
a horse is choosing his name. For instance
my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
couldn't do without him.
(he pats Fritz's neck)
Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
something one does lightly. So once you've
thought about it for awhile -

DJANGO
- Tony.

Dr.SCHULTZ
- Tony what?

DJANGO
- I dunno, Tony the horse.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
Tony?

DJANGO
Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?

Dr.SCHULTZ
When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
Why Tony?

DJANGO
I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
tell ya.
As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

TEXAS"

/Z

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
well. Good job Django, well done.

EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
million other visitors.

Dr.SCHULTZ
What's everybody staring at?

DJANGO
They never seen a nigger on a horse before.

Dr.SCHULTZ
What's this bizarre obsession they have
with. you not riding horses?

DJANGO
You askin' me?
Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.

Dr.SCHULTZ
So what other archaic rituals are you people
verboten to take part in?
As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?

Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
you can do, and what you can't do, and if
you can't do it, why can't you do it?
Like for instance, what if we were to walk
in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
order a drink, and drink it?
Would the authorities frown on that?

DJANGO
Hell yeah, they gonna frown.

Dr.SCHULTZ
What part would they find the most offensive?

DJANGO
All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
with no white man, in public.

Dr.SCHULTZ
So if you and I did those things, that would
be considered enough of a infraction to make
the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

DJANGO
You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case Django, after you.

DJANGO
Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Django you're going to have to learn to trust
me, and as the man said; "There's no time
like the,present."
He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
establishment.

INT - SALOON - MORNING
The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
saloon.
The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
away from the two patrons.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
weary travelers.

SALOON KEEPER
It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
for about a hour. But by then we'll be
servin' breakfast -
He turns around and sees them.

SALOON KEEPER
Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
get that nigger outta here.

IT

TIME CUT

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
of the bar to get the Sheriff.
When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
and that would fall under the domain of the
Sheriff.
The Saloon Keeper runs away.
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.

Dr.SCHULTZ
It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

DJANGO
What kinda dentist are you?
This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
it's a disaster - But these days I practice
a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
This gets no reaction from Django.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
The Black Man shakes his head, no.
As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,

HE EXPLAINS;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well the way the slave trade deals in
human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
deals in corpses.

Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
The state places a bounty on a man's head.
I track that man, I find that man, I kill
that man. After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities -
and sometimes that's easier said then done.
I show that corpse to the authorities -
proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
- At which point, the authorities pay me
the bounty.
(lifting his beer)
Cheers.
The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.

DJANGO
What's a bounty?

Dr.SCHULTZ
It's like a reward.

DJANGO
You kill people and they give you a reward?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Certain people, yes.

DJANGO
White people?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

DJANGO
Bad people?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Badder they are, bigger the reward.
Which brings me to you, and I must admit
I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
On the other hand, I need your help,
and if you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better. So for the time being,
I'm going to make this slave malarkey
work to my benefit.

(BEAT)
Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

. DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis
Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I know what they look like, all right.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
with me till we find them -

DJANGO
- Where we goin'?

Dr.SCHULTZ
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
That means we visit every plantation in
Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
find them, you point them out, and I kill
them. You do that, I agree to give you
your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
I've already gave him to you -- but once the
final Brittle brother lies dead in the
dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
included.
Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.

Dr.SCHULTZ
And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

SHERIFF SHARP
Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
As they do, The Sheriff says;

SHERIFF SHARP
Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
start trouble, and scare all these nice
people? You ain't got nothin' better to
do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
and show your ass -
From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

.THEN...
A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
dirt.
The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
As is Django.
As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

PEDESTRIAN
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
skull, killing him dead.
In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Now you can go get the marshall.

TIME CUT

EXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY
U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.

MARSHALL TATUM
Move that buckboard over there long ways
across the street from the saloon. And I
want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
And I want two men with two rifles on this
roof, and two men with two rifles on that
roof, with all barrels pointed at that
front door. And somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

LP
Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
building across the street from the saloon.
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.

WHEN...

COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...

INT - SALOON - DAY
Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
on the window.
Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.

Dr.SCHULTZ
What are they doing?

DJANGO
I think they wonderin' why you playin'
the piana'.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Good.

(PAUSE)
But what are they doing?

DJANGO
A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
around out front, now they hidin' behind it
with guns. And a buncha other white folks
are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
down here.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
marshall out there?

DJANGO
If the one I think is the.marshall is the
marshall, he's out there.

Dr.SCHULTZ
What makes you think he's the marshall?

DJANGO
Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
You in the saloon!
Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
We got eleven Winchesters on every way
outta that buildin'! You got once chance
git outta this alive! You and your nigger
come out right now with your hands over
your head, and I mean, right now!

Dr.SCHULTZ
First things first! Is this the marshall
I have the pleasure of addressing?

MARSHALL TATUM
Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
myself of all weapons, and just as you
have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
with my hands raised above my head.
I trust as a representative of the
criminal justice system of The United
States of America, I shant be shot down
in the street, by either you or your deputies,
before I've had my day in court.

MARSHALL TATUM
You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
'em down like a dog in the street!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
have your word as a lawman not to shoot
me down like a dog in the street?

MARSHALL TATUM
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
cheat the hangman in my town!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!

Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
They're a little tense out there. So don't
make any quick movements, and let me do
the talking.
Django looks at him like, "as if..."

EXT - SALOON/MAIN STREET - DAY
A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
outside.

MARSHALL TATUM
You unarmed?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
address you, your deputies, and apparently
the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
incident that just occurred?

MARSHALL TATUM
Go on!

Dr.SCHULTZ
My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
to elect as their sheriff, who went by
the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
with a price on his head of two hundred
dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
or alive.

MARSHALL TATUM
The hell you say!

Dr.SCHULTZ
I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
news. But I'm willing to wager this man
was elected sheriff sometime in the last
two years. I know this because. three years
ago he was rustling cattle from,
The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
Lubbock Texas.

Z/

Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
In my possession. is a warrant made out by
circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
He will back up who I am, and who your
dear departed sheriff was.
The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.

Dr.SCHULTZ
In other words marshall, you owe me
two hundred dollars.

CUT TO

EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.

Dr.SCHULTZ
One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
times. A man who survives, is a man with
a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
a good plan. So, having said that, what's
your plan, young Django?

DJANGO
What'cha mean?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, after this Brittle business is behind
us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
What's your plan after that?

DJANGO
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
Do most slaves take the institution of
matrimony seriously?

DJANGO
Huh?

ZZ

Dr.SCHULTZ
Do slaves believe in marriage'?

DJANGO
Me and my wife do.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Where is she now?

DJANGO
I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
She got sold two days 'fore me.
But I don't know who to.
Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Care for some jerky?

DJANGO
Sure.
Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,

SCHULTZ SAYS;

Dr.SCHULTZ
So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
where she is?
A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
the dilemma, then pronounces;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
So how long ago did all this happen?

DJANGO
A few months ago.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Three or four?

DJANGO
Three.

Dr.SCHULTZ
So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation,
and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
monthsago?
Django nods his head, yes.

Z3

Dr.SCHULTZ
The bad part about slavery being a business,
is it's immoral. The good part about it being
a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
name in it, and the name of the customer who
bought her, and more then likely their address.
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
not going to get you very far in Greenville.
Not to mention a slave auction town in
Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
visit. Free or not.

DJANGO
I'll have my freedom papers.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes you will. But say you show them to some
rascals, and they take them from you and
tear them up?

DJANGO
They could do that?

Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not saying they would, but they could.

DJANGO
They do that I'll kill 'em.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
man. The point being is the place,is just
too dangerous for you.

DJANGO
Well I gotta go, when do I go?

Dr.SCHULTZ
When you get more dangerous.

EXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY
Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that.
sells SERVANT/HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS. Django comes bursting out of the
stores back door. He's very distressed. One glance at the outfit he's
wearing explains the distress.

Z

DJANGO
is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that
wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at
Versailles.
Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
You're playing a character. Your character
is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
Remember what I told you. During the act,
you can never break character.

CUT TO

EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
wonder at this sight.
The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
at the darkee on the horse.

SPENCER BENNETT
It's against the law for niggers to ride
horses in this territory.

Dr.SCHULTZ
This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

SPENCER BENNETT
I said niggers -

Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django, he's a free man, and
he can ride what he pleases.

SPENCER BENNETT
Not on my.property, around my niggers
he can't.

Dr.SCHULTZ
My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
valet, Django, and these are our horses,
Fritz, and Tony.
Fritz, does his head bow.
This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
are a gentleman, and a business man.
And it is in these capacities that we've
ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
with you now.

SPENCER BENNETT
State your business.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I wish to purchase one of your
nigger gals.

SPENCER BENNETT
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
no appointment, no nuttin'?

Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm afraid so.

SPENCER BENNETT
Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
say about that?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
I've been led to believe you to be,
I have five thousand things I might say,
that could change your mind.
i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
Spencer laughs.

ZG

SPENCER BENNETT
C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool
to drink.
The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Maybe while we discuss business, you
could provide one of your loveliest black
creatures to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.

SPENCER
Absolutely. Betina!
A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
BETINA, snaps to attention.

BETINA
Yes sir, Big Daddy?

SPENCER

(TO SCHULTZ)
What's your Jimmies name again?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Django.

SPENCER
Betina sugar, take Django around the
grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.

BETINA
As you please, Big Daddy.
Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
treated as an extension of myself.

SPENCER
Understood., Schultz. Betina?

BETINA
Yes, sir?

SPENCER
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
him like any of these other niggers around
here, cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?

BETINA
Ya want I should treat 'em like white
folks?

SPENCER
No that's not what I said.

BETINA
Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Yes, I can see that.

(HE THINKS)
What's the name of that peckawood boy from
town works with the glass? His mama works
at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
the winda's when we have a problem?
The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;

MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
Oh, you mean Jerry.

SPENCER
Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.

(TO BETINA)
You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

BETINA
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Well that's it then... just treat 'em
like you would Jerry.

EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

BETINA
What'cha do for your massa'?

DJANGO
Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

BETINA
So you really free?

DJANGO
Yes.

ZY

BETINA
You mean you wanna dress like that?
Django fumes.

EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
lemonade.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I've been'told by those who should know,
the most exquisite African flesh in the
state of Tennessee is bred right here on
your land. And from the look of these
black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

SPENCER
Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
field. But the lion share of my lady
niggers are real show pony's.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
pony for young Django. So the only
question that remains is, do you have a
nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

SPENCER
Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
is practically my middle name.

BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

DJANGO
Betina, come over here, I need to ask
you something.
He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

BETINA
What'cho want?

DJANGO
I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
brothers. Overseers. Their name is
Brittle. Do you know 'em?

BETINA
Brittle?

DJANGO
Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

BETINA
I don't know dem.

DJANGO
They could be usin' a different name.
They woulda' come to the plantation in
the last year.

BETINA
You mean The Shaffer's?

DJANGO
Maybe? Three brother?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Are they here?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Can you point one of 'em out to me?

BETINA
Well ones over in that field.
She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
field landscape.

SPYGLASS POV:
Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
observation.

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a

BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
he lowers the glass.

BETINA

(INNOCENTLY)
Is that who you lookin' for?

DJANGO
Yep.
He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.

DJANGO
Where's the other two?

BETINA.
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
for breakin' eggs.

DJANGO
They whippin' Little Jody?
She nods her head, yes.

DJANGO
Point me in that direction.
She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.

BETINA
You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."

DJANGO
Go git that white man, I came here with.
He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
and The Brittle Brothers.

FLASH ON
A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his

BULLWHIP.
DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.

DJANGO
Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
She's real sorry!
The WHIP RIPS her back.

DJANGO

(SCREAMING)
Goddamit, Big John!

LITTLE RAJ
Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
Brittle with everything he has.

BACK TO DJANGO
crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.

FLASH ON
Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the

KNEELING DJANGO;

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
I like the way you beg, boy.

EXT - STABLE - DAY
Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
to a dead tree stump.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers/The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
are clumsy. You'd break everything in
goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
only known cure for nigger clumsiness
is a peelin'.
Little Jody begs to differ.

BACK TO DJANGO
As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
little dogs no nevermind.

BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE
In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.

BIG JOHN
After this we'll see if you break eggs again.

DJANGO
turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...

WHEN ...
.DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;

DJANGO
John Brittle!
Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
Bulldogs.
LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
the same thing in the mirror.
LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
DJANGO just stares back.
BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
So does Roger.

LITTLE RAJ
Django?
Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
shake his hand ...

DJANGO
Remember me?
.Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.

BIG JOHN FACE
goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
heart, at Django.

DJANGO
I like the way you die, boy.
Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
it.
LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
It goes off... BANG.
SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
MORE SLAVES gather.

DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
Django, and the two dead bodies.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Who are they?

DJANGO
That's John Brittle, and that's his
little brother Raj.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Where's Ellis?

DJANGO
He's the one hightailin' it across that
field right now.
Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
to make an escape.

SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you sure that's him?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
Yes!

Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I dunno.

Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't know if you're positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I don't know what, positive,'means.

Dr.SCHULTZ
It means you're sure.

DJANGO
Yes.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, what?

DJANGO
Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

BAM!
The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
Django does the same with his pistol.
Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!

SPENCER
Just who the hell are you two jokers?
Dr. SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
of the criminal justice system of the
United States of America. The man to my
left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
Roger Brittle --

DJANGO
- They were goin by the name, Shaffer.

Dr.SCHULTZ
You know them by the name, Shaffer.
But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
These are wanted men. The law wants them
for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
states dead or alive. When Django and myself
executed these men on sight, we were operating
within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
passions are high. But I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a officer of the court in the
performance of his duty is, you will be
hung by the neck until you are dead.
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
After his dramatic pause for effect...
.Dr.Schultz says;

Dr.SCHULTZ
May I please remove the warrant from my
pocket so you may examine it?
Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
paper.

SPENCER
Gimmie.
Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
what it says.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Satisfied.
Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.

Dr.SCHULTZ
May I have that back?
,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.

Dr.SCHULTZ
We good?

BENNETT
Get off my land.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Post haste.

(TO DJANGO)
Load up the bodies as quickly as
you can, and let's get out of
here.

TIME CUT
All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
the bounty hunters brought with them.
Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
for one final threat.

BENNETT
Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
while you on my property. But for lettin' a
nigger kill a white man, and especially for
letting a nigger kill a white man in a
audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
it out of the county alive. Mark my words
Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
from my motherfuckin' gate.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
regulator playmates aren't shy about
killing for what you believe in. But mark
my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
towards Django or myself, you better be
prepared to die for it.
The two men ride off.
The Black and White Audience watch them go.

EXT -- A TENNESSEE LAKE - NIGHT
INSERT: Dr.Schultz's SADDLE BAG, the doctor's hands remove THREE STICKS
/!. OF DYNAMITE from it.
INSERT: The doctor's HANDS bind the Three Sticks of Dynamite together.
INSERT: The Three Sticks are WRAPPED UP in a BRIGHT YELLOW BANDANA.
INSERT: The Yellow Dynamite Sticks, are buried in dirt about half way,
with the yellow part protruding from out of the ground.

CUT TO.

CU SPENCER BENNETT
lying on his belly in the grass.

SPENCER BENNETT
That's them sonsabitches.

SPENCER'S POV:
We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers
lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE
CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK,
all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth
holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
steed..

SPENCER BENNETT
Now unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
personally, strip and clip that garboon
myself.
Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

SPENCER BENNETT
Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
this thing.
He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.

BRADSHAW
We ready, or what?

SPENCER BENNETT
Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.

(RIPS)
Shit ...I just made it worse.
He rips. it off his head in frustration.

RANDY
I can't see shit either.

REDFISH
Who made this goddamn shit?

0. B.
Willards wife.

WILLARD
Well make you own goddamn masks!

SPENCER

(TO WILLARD)
Look nobody's saying they don't appreciate
what Jenny did.

REDFISH
Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
could cut it better then this.

0. B.
How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?

ROBERT
Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
all over, and I'm riding blind.
Randy tears at his bag.

RANDY
Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
He puts it on-then says;

RANDY
Yep, it's worse.
He yanks it off his head.

RANDY
Did anybody bring any extra bags?

TERRY
No, no one brought a extra bag!

RANDY
I'm just asking.

DOUG
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

SPENCER
Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
up, that just defeats the purpose.
Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.

REDFISH
I can't see in this fucking thing!
I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
And I can't ride in this fucking thing!

WILLARD
Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
Willard rides off.
O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.

SPENCER
O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
not dead.

O.B.
But Willards riding off.

SPENCER
Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

RANDY
Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
Robert takes off his bag, and says;

ROBERT
I think we all think the bags was a nice
idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
could of been done better. So how 'bout,
no bags this time, but next time, we do the
bags right, and then we go full regalia.
Everyone takes off their bag.

SPENCER
Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!

YO

TERRY
But nobody can see.

SPENCER
So?

TERRY
So, it would be nice to see.

SPENCER
Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
can't see, so what? All that matters is can
the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.

EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
"Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."
Then amongst the confusion...

WE SNAP ZOOM TO

A BIG TREE
on the other side of the lake
Then quickly cut into The Tree.
Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ
with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye.

SCOPE SIGHT POV
The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground, are
inside the scope sight circle, Horse hooves step around it.

TWO SHOT
Dr.SCHtJLTZ and DJANGO up in a tree.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Auf wiedersehen.

L,
He fires.
The Camp EXPLODES Blowing Horses and Riders Apart.
Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Let 'em have it!

DJANGO
I can't see nothin'.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Just fire into the smoke.
The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.

INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
dogs.

SPENCER BENNETT
on his horse with the other fleeing regulators RIDES for his life...

SCOPE SIGHT POV
We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs.

DJANGO
scope sight rifle up to his eye.
Schultz next to him, says;

Dr.SCHULTZ
He's getting away.

DJANGO
I got 'em.

SPENCER'S HORSE
his hooves race and rip up the grass.

SPENCER
riding for his life...

DJANGO
scope sight rifle up to his eye.

Dr.SCHULTZ
He's getting out of range.

DJANGO
I got 'em.
INSERT: A black finger squeezes the rifle trigger.

SPENCER BENNETT
we're behind him as he rides away, OFF SCREEN we hear the whistling of
what sounds like an incoming missle.

SPENCER BENNETT
we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet,
RIPS THROUGH his CHEST.

DJANGO

DJANGO
I got 'em.

SPENCER BENNETT
falls from his horse, dead.

DJANGO
scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to
Dr.Schultz.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Like that, huh?
Referring to the scope sight rifle;

DJANGO
I like.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, I think while they take this opportunity
to lick their wounds, we should take this
opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
They hop out of the tree.

MONTAGE
Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his
first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to
purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django,
with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright
on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as
his winter coat.

EXT - COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides alongside
the good doctor Schultz. The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.

Dr.SCHULTZ
But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

DJANGO
She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
were sayin' where I gotta go first?

Dr.SCHULTZ
There'should be some sort of records office.
You know when she was sold, you know where
she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
you know her name ... . what is her name?

DJANGO
Broomhilda.
Schultz reacts.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda?
Django.nods his head yes.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Were her owners German?
Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?

DJANGO
Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
speak a little German too.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Your wife?

DJANGO
Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.

Dr.SCHULTZ
So let me get this straight, your slave
wife speaks German, and her name is
Broomhilda Von Shaft...?

DJANGO
Yep. Mouthful, huh?

Dr.SCHULTZ
To say the least.
(stopping the horse)
This looks like a very pretty place to have
our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

TIME CUT

EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
cup of tea.

DJANGO
How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
were German?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

DJANGO
Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?

Dr.SCHULTZ
No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
a character in one of the most popular of
all the German legends.

DJANGO
Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes there is.

DJANGO
Do you know it?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Every German knows that story. Would you
like me to tell you?
Django nods his head, yes.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

DJANGO
What she do.?

Dr.SCHULTZ
I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
him in some way. So at first he's just going to
obliterate her -

DJANGO
Obliterate... . what does that mean?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Like blow up.
He pantomimes a explosion.

DJANGO
Phew, that's pretty mad.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
little time, he calms down a bit. He's
still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

DJANGO
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
arises brave enough to save her.

DJANGO
Does a fella arise?
From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
wasn't aware of when the conversation started.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
named, Sigfried.

DJANGO
Does Sigfried save her?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
he's not afraid.of him.

Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
He walks through hellfire because
Broomhilda's worth. it.
After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
as they nibble on their sandwiches.

DJANGO
I know how he feels.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I think I'm just starting to realize that.
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
thinks about what he's going to say next.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
Let me ask you a question, how do you like
the bounty hunting business?

DJANGO
Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
What's not to like?

Dr.SCHULTZ
I hafta admit, we make a good team.

DJANGO
But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
Big John and Rodger?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
overzealous. But normally, that's a good
thing. How'd you like to partner up for
the winter?

DJANGO
What'd ya mean partner up?

Dr.SCHULTZ
You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
for the winter.

DJANGO
You makin' another agreement?

W7

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes. You work with me through the winter,
till the snow melts. I give you a third
of my bounties. And while we're together,
I'll teach you a few things you're going
to need to know.

DJANGO
Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
head bow thing that Fritz can do?

Dr.SCHULTZ
That among other things. We make some
money this winter, when the snow melts,
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
we'll find where they sent your wife.
I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
understandably, he's a little suspicious.

DJANGO
Why you care what happens to me? Why you
care if I find my wife?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well frankly, I've never given anybody
their freedom before. And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
just not ready to go off on your own, it's
that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
obliged to help you on your quest to
rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
Django accepts that response.
What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

WE SEE
A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
to be good at this.

EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.

Y, 8

DOWN BELOW WE SEE
A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON
helping him by leading the horse forward.
On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Keep down or he'll see you.

DJANGO
Who that farmer? Who cares?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
just might.

DJANGO
What? The little man pushin' that plow?

Dr.SCHULTZ
That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is a farmer?

Dr.SCHULTZ
No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
who's hiding out as a farmer, because
there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
his head.
He hands Django the scope rifle case.

Dr.SCHULTZ
And he's all yours my boy.
DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.

SCOPE SIGHT POV:
on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse
and his son.
Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
folks for money?

DJANGO
His son's with him.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
Maybe even share a last word. That's
better then most get, and a damn. sight
better then he deserves.
Django still hesitates.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.

DJANGO

(READING)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and

CRAZY CRAIG KOONS."

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
twenty-two, they would never of printed that.

(REFERRING TO

THE HANDBILL)
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
You want to save your wife by doing what
I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
is worth seven thousand dollars.
Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
Django SHOOTS.
The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out
his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt.

Dr.SCHULTZ
You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.

DJANGO
Why?

Dr.SCHULTZ
It's good luck. You always keep the
handbill of your first bounty.
They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body,
leading the extra body horse behind them.
As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's
Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his
last words to his son before he dies.

Dr.SCHULTZ
See, they're having a tender little father son
moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
they've ever had.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks
a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's
heart would be.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the bottle heart!
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the left coal eye.
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the right coal eye.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the carrot nose.
Dr.Schultz comes up behind him.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I think it's safe to say you're faster then
the snowman.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT
A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through
a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT

FROM ABOVE.

DJANGO AND SCHULTZ
up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them.

EXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT
The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down
the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN
with five corpses.
The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.

SHERIFF GUS
Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
and who the hell ya got there?

Dr.SCHULTZ
The Wilson - Lowe Gang.

SHERIFF GUS
Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
it down to the friendly peace officer.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
And three of their acolytes.

SHERIFF GUS
Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
"That one", Schultz says.
Django RIPS IT off the wall.
As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY
The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django
practices his fast draw against five men...
.by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
falls to the ground to get the fifth.
He looks up from the ground at Schultz.
As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;

Dr.SCHULTZ
You're pretty confident aren't you?
Django nods his head, yes.

Dr.SCHULTZ
You have reason to be.
He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
top of Django.

DJANGO
Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh you're ready for Greenville.
He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
sure.
He blows out the match...

WE GO TO BLACK
What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

BLACK TITLE CARD
ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE LETTER AT A TIME STYLE (ala "Rocky" and

"FLASHDANCE")

MISSISSIPPI

CUT TO

EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit
brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet
have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.
We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in
the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them
along.
BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty
PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of
SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING

THE KIDS ALONG.
Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:

GREENVILLE

CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI
Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
Greenville operates.
As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.

WE FLASH ON
The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.

INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS
amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train
pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.:
A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE
SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo.

JUDD
Good god almighty these niggers stink!

I F

RUSS
Niggers stink, where's the shock?
(to the Slaves

BELOW)
Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen
well, I'm only gonna say this once.
There's a slave corral right across from
this boxcar. We gittin ready to open these
doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you
can, right into that pen. 'Anyone gittin off
trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. Now you
niggers better comprehend. And that goes for
any African garboons amongst y'all can't
understand english ... . your American buddies
better shove your ass in the right direction,
or your trip to this country is going to be
short, and pointless. Train to pen as fast as
you can!
The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
run full out from the train to the steer corral.
We spot Django during the running.
Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.

INSIDE THE CORRAL
through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up
the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen out of
view.
Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the other
LADIES, then she's gone from view.

BACK TO DJANGO (PRESENT)
Django and Dr.Schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight of
Greenville.

Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a spectacle out of Dante.

DJANGO
You should see it from the other side.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.

DJANGO
You'd be surprised what you can endure.

(BEAT)
Where to?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Records office.

CUT TO

INT - RECORDS OFFICE - DAY
Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with books.
We watch through the store front window, the black man and white man
enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking
RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words
routine... . The CAMERA FADES TO BLACK.

BLACK TITLE CARD:

BROOMHILDA

INT - SLAVE PEN - DAY
The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of
the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
the leg irons scrap her ankles.
Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
Street.
Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

BROOMHILDA
looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
breath which one will buy her.
Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.
Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES MEET,
he nudges his dad.
The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
branded in her cheek.
Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

SELLER - CLYDE
Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
nigger gal gentle.

UGLY MAN
makes a bid.

BROOMHILDA
yikes.

UGLIER MAN
higher bid.

BROOMHILDA

A GIGGLING LEERING GROUP OF BROTHERS

A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD INDIAN ON A MULE
makes a bid.
Mr.Harmony makes a bid for his son Scotty.
Broomhilda notices that. And makes more eye contact with Scotty.
They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid.
A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

NARRATOR (VO)
On that day, eight months ago, the auction
was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
for his fat boy son Scotty.
Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

SCOTTY
This is for you.
She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.

SCOTTY
They're jelly beans. Try one.
She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.

SCOTTY
Good huh?
She nods her head, yes.
We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the
back eating her bag of jelly beans.

$XT - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the
back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
realize the young master is the shy type.

BROOMHILDA
Master Scotty... ?

SCOTTY
Yes Broomhilda?

BROOMHILDA
I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
you on that seat so we can talk?

SCOTTY
Please, I'd love that.
She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.

EXT - THE HARMONY HOUSE - DAY
A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
Scotty's mother, Mrs.HARMONY (MARY LOUISE), waits to meet her son, and
his new bought nigger gal.
The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
Mrs.HARMONY
What's your name, gal?

BROOMHILDA
Broomhilda.
Mrs.HARMONY
Follow me. into the kitchen,
('to her son)
You stay out here.

INT - KITCHEN - DAY
Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES
that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs
Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
Mrs.HARMONY
I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
with him, they fool with him for the wrong
reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
wrong, you'll deal with me.

BROOMHILDA
I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
needs is a little confidence.
Mrs.HARMONY
And you'll give that to him?

BROOMHILDA
I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
Mrs.HARMONY
He is, isn't he?

BROOMHILDA
Ah-huh.
The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.

NARRATOR (VO)
Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
bride for young master Scotty that day.
And the two kids had a nice time playing
house for awhile.
We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in
the daytime..
At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.

NARRATOR (VO)
As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
even join the family at their dinner table.
We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
gravy.

NARRATOR.(VO)
And pretty soon she was adopted into a
member of the family.
Mrs.Harmony and Broomhilda sewing together.
The Harmony family and Broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard.
After dinner, Mrs.Harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano.
Mr.Harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook.

NARRATOR (VO)
Scotty was never happier.
Scotty and Broomhilda walking holding hands at Southern magic hour.
Broomhilda having sex with Scotty, baby talking with him, talking him
through it, making him feel loved and secure.

NARRATOR (VO)
After three months of this bliss,
Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
a romantic weekend in Greenville.

SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA
drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a
fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress,
complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol.
Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best
described as plantation pimp daddy.

NARRATOR (VO)
White masters would take their pretty
Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
how bad the other slaves had it, always made
the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
position, (just in case they'd forgot).

BROOMHILDA
holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the
OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel
lobby, and rent a room at the front desk.

INSERT: HOTEL REGISTRY
Scotty signs his name. The DESK CLERKS HAND checks the box on the
registry book that indicates darkee female companion.

INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT
Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS
showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets.

NARRATOR (VO)
And two, there was a sliver of society that
ran through Greenville at night that catered
to white masters who were infected with a
condition that was normally referred to as,
"Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.

EXT - CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT
An establishing shot.of the three story house that has been converted into
private club called, The Cleopatra Club.

NARRATOR (VO)
But the crown jewel of all this interracial
frivolity, was the members only, Cleopatra
Club.

INSERT: GOLD PLAQUE
with the name, THE CLEOPATRA CLUB on it, next to it is a profile of
Nefertiti.

INT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean
white men and black women).
Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining
room.
We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE,
sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
I love you. And if loving you means I go to
hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed
was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.

NARRATOR (VO)
Then... speak of the devil and the devil
appears.

CALVIN CANDIE
appears at their table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
to welcome an attractive couple'like
yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.

SCOTTY
Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
We love it here.
Pointing at a empty chair.

CALVIN CANDIE
May I join you?-

SCOTTY
Please, by all means.
Calvin sits down.
Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long have you been a member?

SCOTTY
We just joined this weekend.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well our little private oasis appreciates
your patronage. Some may consider the dues
excessive, but they're necessary for us to
create this haven for the alternative
lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.

SCOTTY
Well said, and money well spent.
He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.
Candie sees this.

CALVIN CANDIE
It would be.my pleasure, your first
weekend at the club, to join me and my
friends at my table.
Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
with a, "Don't be silly."
We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
join the party.
Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
is a little more revealing then the others.
They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

NARRATOR (VO)
After excusing herself, she walked across
the street to her hotel room. She got
her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
scrape every pimple.

-. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB
The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.

NARRATOR (VO)
Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
card game. As the game wore on, it came down
to a two thousand dollar pot between
Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
something in his ear.

CANDIE

(TO SHEBA)
Really?

(TO SCOTTY)
You know what Sheba just tole me?
Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;

SCOTTY
What?

CANDIE
She says she thinks you're cute.

SCOTTY
Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
beautiful.
Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.

CANDIE
Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
lip. Want some lip?
Scotty, is a little surprised.

SCOTTY
Well, she's your Pony...I mean...

CANDIE
Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
Calvin's side of the table.
The game continues.

G

CANDIE
Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
it. If you're really holding cards, time to
pony up. I raise you five hundred.
Candie throws in his chips.

SCOTTY.
I see your five hundred...
(throws in chips)
.and raise you four hundred more.
(tosses his last chips)
Call.
This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.

CALVIN CANDIE
Not so fast, boy.

(BEAT)
Pot ain't fat enough yet.

SCOTTY
I'm all in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ain't that too bad.
Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.

SCOTTY
I would think a southern gentleman of
such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.

CALVIN CANDIE
One final raise.
Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"

CALVIN CANDIE
It's Sheba's bill of sale.

SCOTTY
What? I don't want her.
Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.

CALVIN CANDIE
You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
More laughter.

CALVIN CANDIE
In Greenville slaves are currency. And
Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
fold?

SCOTTY
I'm all out of money.

CALVIN CANDIE
But we ain't playin' for money no more..
We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
you got.

SCOTTY
I can't bet Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
and a pencil.
Somebody does.

CALVIN CANDIE
Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
Scotty makes a pressured decision.
He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
Let me see your cards!
Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH.
What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.

SCOTTY
You cheated me.
After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
What did you just call me?

SCOTTY
I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
cause that's what you are!
Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer
Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty.
Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front
himself .
Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
I challenge you to a duel.
(to the Piano

PLAYER)
Piano player, will you hit three separate
notes?

(TO SCOTTY)
On the third note, pick up the gun and
try to kill me.
(to Piano player)
Piano player please ...
This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.

SCOTTY
Wait a minute ...no!

FIRST NOTE ...

SCOTTY
I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
to duel!

CALVIN CANDIE
Then get out of here, get in your buggy
and get out of town.

SCOTTY
Sure. Let me just get my girl.

CALVIN CANDIE
You lost that girl, fat boy.

SECOND NOTE...

SCOTTY
Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
give you Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
to fuckin' another one.

(BEAT)
Or pick up that gun.
Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his
parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't
leave.

THIRD NOTE...
Calvin Candie SHOOTS Scotty Harmony dead.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Calvin Candie and his entourage enter the hotel lobby and go up to the

FRONT DESK CLERK..

CALVIN CANDLE
Hello Oliver.

FRONT DESK CLERK (OLIVER)
Hello Mr.Candie, good evening.

CALVIN CANDLE
Good evening to you as well,. young Oliver.
Could you please inform me which room
your guest Scott Harmony is staying in?

INT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Broomhilda is asleep in bed...

WHEN ...
.Calvin comes'BURSTING in the room holding his belt in his hand. He
YANKS OFF the sheets that Broomhilda sleeps under. Broomhilda lies
naked under the covers. Candie brings the belt down around her legs and
backside.
She hops out of bed.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Candie CHASES her naked body with his belt, from the top of the stairs,
down the stairs, and through the lobby, and out the front door.
All to the amusement of the WHITE HOTEL GUESTS.

EXT - GREENVILLE HOTEL - NIGHT
She RUNS out of the hotel naked, and then TRIPS FALLING INTO THE
GREENVILLE MUD. She looks up from the mud, at Calvin Candie looking
down at her.

CALVIN CANDIE
Welcome to Candyland.
We do a SLOW ZOOM into Broomhilda's face.

NARRATOR (VO)
That was four months ago.

CUT TO

INT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY
Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room.
The same room Django was sold in at the beginning.
Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or sold
fill the big hall.

ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO)
stands half naked on the auction block.
The SELLER' (SHELBY)
gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding.
Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo, including
Calvin Candie.

Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES
/-. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing.
FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE
We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW,
always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler
hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below.
Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him.

Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
owner of Candyland.

DJANGO
Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, so you heard of it?

DJANGO
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well apparently, that's where your wife is,
and apparently the repellent gentleman down
there is the one who owns her.

TIME CUT
The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction
hall.

Dr.SCHULTZ
How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

DJANGO
Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
a couple niggers he'd fight.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you play a mandingo expert?

DJANGO
What?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
who is an expert on mandingo fighters?

DJANGO
Why?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Because when a man has one of the four
biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
his attention, we better be talking about
big sweaty black males. So my character is
that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
fight game. And your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.

DJANGO
They call that "One-Eyed Charly."

Dr.SCHULTZ.
One-Eyed Charly?

DJANGO
That's what you call it when you buy a slave
expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
Dr'. SCHULTZ
Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?

DJANGO
You know, back on the plantation, my. job
wasn't historian.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
yes, if you can't.

DJANGO
You want me to play a black slaver? There
ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
Django gets that.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you do that?

DJANGO
That, I can do. What's next?

Dr.SCHULTZ
To get ourselves personally invited to
Candyland by Calvin Candie himself.

CUT TO

EXT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT

Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO stand across the street from The Cleopatra Club.
Which looks like aregular nice three story house, among other.nice
houses on an affluent residential block in Greenville Mississippi.
They open the tiny garden gate in front of the house, walk up the stoop
steps to the front door. They ring the doorbell.
A pretty young black girl, dressed in a FRENCH MAID outfit opens the
door.

FRENCH MAID

(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Bonjour.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(AMUSED)
Bonjour, mon petite femme noire.
We are here to see Calvin Candie.
She's been taught to smile and say:

FRENCH MAID
Enter.
The two men walk into the entrance way of the house.
A beautiful mulatto HOSTESS greets the two men.

HOSTESS

(SPEAKING QUITE

REFINED)
Hello gentlemen, I'm Cleo, can I help you?
Dr.Schultz hands Cleo the guest card.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes I am Dr.King Schultz, and this is my
associate, Django Freeman.
Upon hearing Django is a free man her eyes go to, him.

Dr.SCHULTZ
We're here for a appointment with
Calvin Candie and Leo Moguy.

CLEO
Yes you gentlemen are expected. Please
make yourself comfortable. I'll inform
Monsieur Candie you've arrived.
(referring to the

FRENCH MAID)
Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen
a tasty refreshment?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Not at the moment.

CLEO
Then Coco will entertain you while I
inform Monsieur Candie.

Dr.SCHULTZ
How charming.
Cleo leaves.
Django wanders over the dining room, and peers inside.

INT - DINING ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
A lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house. The DINERS
are made up exclusively of well dressed WHITE MEN, and pretty BLACK
GIRLS (PONYS) dressed in the most elaborate ladies fashions of the day.
Some appear to be on dates.
Some appear to be enjoying a special evening (birthday, anniversary,
special treat).
- Some are.two men with two women.
Some are one man with two or three or more women.
The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men.
The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen.
The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty beef
driven American dining.
The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with
elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana
splits, and cookies.
While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
sarsaparilla.
Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Have you ever seen anything like this
before?
Django shakes his head, no.

COCO CHIRPS;

COLO. -

(VERY COUNTRY)
Y'all gonna dine, it's real good. You
like catfish, we got good catfish. They use
alotta butta. You like sand dabs, we
got sand dabs.
LEO MOGUY descends from the clubs prominent staircase.

MOGUY
Dr.Schultz, good to see you again.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity for this
appointment.
Mr.MOGUY
Nonsense, it's my job.

(CON'T)
Mr.MOGUY

(CON'T)

(LOOKING AT

DJANGO)
.So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard
so much about.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's
lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.

MOGUY
Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard
room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come
along too?

Dr.SCHULTZ
We would be quite lucky indeed if the
charming Coco cared.to follow.
Coco blushes.

MOGUY
You better watch out doctor, you gonna
steal this little pony's heart.
They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they

SAY;

Dr.SCHULTZ
How long have you been associated with
Mr.Candie?

MOGUY
Calvin and I were about eleven when we
went to boarding school together. One
could almost say, I was raised to be
Calvin's lawyer.

DJANGO
One could almost say, you a nigger.
Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to
Mr.Moguy.

MOGUY
What did you say?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
know before I meet him?

MOGUY
Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.

Dr.SCHULTZ
What civilized people aren't?

MOGUY
That's why all the French ambiance. And
he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRENCH)
What ever he prefers.
This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.

MOGUY
Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.
They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
Moguy slides the doors open...
The party enters the billiard room.

INT - BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
fight to death in this closed room.
An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO

VASSEPI.
Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Why do you want to get in the mandingo
business?
That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted;

Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
(referring to Moguy)
.to make the proper introductions?
Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;

CALVIN CANDIE
Quit stalling and answer the question.
The room is quiet.

Dr.SCHULTZ
The awful truth?

(PAUSE)
I'm bored, and it seems like a good
bit of fun.
Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
goin on that's a good bit of fun.
Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

CALVIN CANDIE.
The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
him today. What's his name, Moguy?

MOGUY
Big Fred.

CALVIN CANDIE
The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.

(TO AMERIGO)
What's your nigger's name?

AMERIGO
Luigi... .?
Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
named, ROSCOE tends it.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
a good bit of fun?

DJANGO
You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.

CALVIN CANDIE
How'd you two like to try the signature drink
of the club?

Dr.SCHULTZ
We'd love to.

CALVIN CANDIE
(yelling to the

BARTENDER)
Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
don't spare the rum.
Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
Big Fred kills Luigi.
Candie and his friends cheer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
like you owe me ten dollars.
Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a
sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
Candle turns his attention to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's your name, boy?

Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Where'd ya dig him up?

Dr.SCHULTZ
A fortuitous turn of events brought
Django and myself together.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
real bright boy.

(BEAT)
I'm curious, what makes you such a
mandingo expert?

DJANGO
I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;

BARTHOLOMEW
What you say, boy?
/. Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.

CALVIN CANDIE
Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
you directed your line of inquiry to me.

CALVIN CANDIE
Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.

Dr.SCHULTZ
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
didn't seek you out for your advice. I
sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.
I was'under the impression when you
granted me an audience, it would be to
discuss business.

CALVIN CANDIE
No we weren't talking business yet. We
were discussing my curiosity.
Now according to Moguy here, if I do
business with you...

(POINTING TO

SCHULTZ)
, .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

(POINTING TO

DJANGO)
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
but more or less, yes.
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
Candie turns his attention back to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
looked over my African flesh, and were
none too impressed.

FLASH ON
we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..

BACK TO CLEO CLUB

DJANGO
Not for top dollar.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well then we got nothing more to talk
about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
from me, those are the beat ass niggers
I wanna sell.

DJANGO
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
sell. He wants the nigger you don't
wanna sell.

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
sell.
Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-

Dr.SCHULTZ
You won't sell your best. You won't even
sell your second best. But your third
best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
forced to consider it... . who knows what
could happen?

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you consider ridiculous?

Dr.SCHULTZ.
For a truly talented specimen,
."The Right Nigger"..:?
How much would you say, Django?

DJANGO
Twelve thousand dollars.
Calvin Candle takes in the figure.

CALVIN CANDIE
Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
you got my attention.

TIME CUT

TNT -- CLEOPATRA CLUB -- RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat dinner
in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats Catfish.
And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.

CALVIN CANDIE
How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO COCO)
How's your Catfish, dew drop?

COCO
Real good Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
You spend a lot of time around niggers
aside from Freeman here?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Not so much.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
treat this was for 'em. You feel special
Coco?

COCO
Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
You feel special Bartholomew?

BARTHOLOMEW
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?

SHEBA
Yep.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
special?

DJANGO

(MEANING SHEBA)
Not as special as her.
The table breaks out in laughter.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well we're leaving bright and early
tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
You oughta come with us.
Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
suppose I could be amenable to that.
How far must we trek?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
There you can get a look at my best
specimens. Have dinner with my sister
and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
my guest.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.

WE CUT

EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
"Candyland."
Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS
(BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled
with'supplies.
FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction
walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.

THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER) WHO
WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like
with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.

J

RODNEY
walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.

FLASH ON
Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.

RODNEY
gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.

DJANGO ON TONY
sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let
that shit stand.
He yells down to the powerless man;

DJANGO
Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
Rodney looks away.

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
You want a boot heel in it?

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
Flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give ya reason not to like me!
As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but
not without difficulty.
Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.

Dr.SCHULTZ
How do you like this side of the slave
trade?

DJANGO
Not so much.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Prefer the other side?

DJANGO
I didn't say that.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.

DJANGO
Are you sure it's her?

Dr.SCHULTZ
He didn't call her by name, but she's a
young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
assume, in this instance, I think it's
pretty safe.

DJANGO
Did you offer to buy her?

Dr.SCHULTZ
I opened the door to my possible interest.
But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
so interested.

SUDDENLY ...
Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...

CALVIN CANDLE
Am I intruding?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Of course not.

CALVIN CANDIE

(APPRAISING THE

TWO MEN)
I swear you two are cozier then a couple
of cuttle fish.

Dr.SCHULTZ
You'd be surprised what a good
conversationalist Django is.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh by now, I don't think that would
surprise meat all.
Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.

Dr.SCHULTZ
When do we reach your property?

CALVIN CANDLE
You been on it. I own the whole sixty
miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.

CALVIN CANDIE
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

(YELLING BEHIND
him at Billy)
Billy Crash, git up here!
Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
rides up.

BILLY CRASH
Yeah, Boss?

CALVIN CANDIE
Find out what that goddamn commotion
is up at the tracker shack!

BILLY CRASH
Right away, Boss.
Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know, confidentially, just 'tween
us girls, worse things about this
business, ain't the slaves. It's all
the white trash ya gotta deal with.
Like these peckawoods we got riding with
us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
And don't think they don't know it either.
It's about the only thing these dumbass
motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
niggers ass, other than somebody might as
well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
patience, that German lady taught Hildi
how to speak German.
Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his
, emotions betray nothing.

PTE

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
Billy Crash comes riding back.

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell's goin on?

BILLY CRASH
They got 'em a runaway.

CALVIN CANDIE
Who?

CUT TO

EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway
slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
bunkhouse.
The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty
long haired lot.
Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and
JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons,
or just from the same hollow.
Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of

MARSHA.
A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
patch.

O V5
The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look
down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
a fool thing like run off?

D'ARTAGNAN
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
myself think!
Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
Mr.STONESIPHER
Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
(to the other

TRACKERS)
Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
he's just makin' em hungry.
The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long was he loose?
Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
Mr.STONESIPHER
A.night. Day. Half the other night.

CALVIN CANDIE
How far he git off property?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
considering that limp he got.

CALVIN CANDIE
Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
Friday?.

MOGUY
(pointing behind him)
One of this new lot.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.

(TO D'ARTAGNAN)
Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
a tail on a teddy bear.
D'Artagnan starts begging.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
business. Now I done paid five hundred
dollars for you. And when I pay five
hundred dollars, I expect to get five
fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
and play dead. You've fought three fights.

D'ARTAGNAN
I won every one.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
muddied the line between winning and losing.
Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
on the ground.

CALVIN CANDIE
But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
dollars, I want five fights. So what
about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
reimburse me?
The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
know what to expect from their new home.
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
bastard.
Calvin prods further.

CALVIN CANDIE
You even know what reimburse means?

E 17
The Whites laugh.
Then SUDDENLY ...
.The German Speaks;

Dr.SCHULTZ
I'll reimburse you.
All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
direction of the good German.

CALVIN CANDIE
You will?
Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes.

CALVIN CANDIE
You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
broom?
Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.

DJANGO
No he won't.
All eyes turn to Django.

DJANGO
He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
right, Doc?
Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached
to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
billfold back in his suit coat pocket.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO CANDIE)
You heard 'em.
The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the
green jacket, slack jawed.
Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.

CALVIN CANDIE
You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
Mr. Stonesipher?
Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
Mr.STONESIPHER
That's right.
Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well now since you won't pay a penny for
this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger however I see fit?

DJANGO
He's your nigger.

CALVIN CANDIE
Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Marsha...git 'em!
The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
Shepherds back.
The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...

THE MANDINGOS
all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
Candie.staring contest with Django...
Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as
the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
appears not to enjoy it.
Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then back
-. to Django.

P9

CALVIN CANDIE
Your boss looks a little green around
the gills for a blood sport like
nigger fightin'?
As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.

DJANGO
Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.

CALVIN CANDIE
But you are use to it?

DJANGO
Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
a little more use to American's then
he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
ready, we rode five hours so you could
show off your stock. Let's git to it.
Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
ain't impressed.
Calvin...BLINK...
Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
his horse, then looks at the black man.

CALVIN CANDIE
Follow me.
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
apart.

EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
picking it.
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
Django.
All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
get a better look at the black riding a horse.
Django looks back matching their stare.

EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
(very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
among his SHEEP.
KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
begins tossing them about.
The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

THEN ...
.DJANGO rides by.
The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
same village.
And they too see Django ... . WOW!
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
or The Big House as everyone calls it.
To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
night nigger fights.
All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
hands) come out to greet the caravan.
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
huge dust cloud behind it.
Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
the Big House to greet her brother.
Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.
steps...

STEPHEN
eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
South. -
Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
(almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

THEN...
Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
and for a moment don't know what to think.
Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
limp.
All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello Stephen my boy!

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
this nigger up on that nag?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

STEPHEN
Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
on that nag?

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Snowball.
: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony.

DJANGO
If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
my horse, you ask me.

STEPHEN
Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.

CALVIN CANDIE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
funny. Django's a Freeman.
Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.

STEPHEN
This nigger, here?

CALVIN CANDIE
That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
the two of. you. Django, this is another
cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
Stephen, this is Django. You two should
hate each other.
Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
blacks at Candyland.

STEPHEN
Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
feel the need to entertain?

CALVIN CANDIE
Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
are customers, and they are our guests
Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
.are to show them every hospitality.
Do you understand that?

STEPHEN
I don't know why I gotta -

CALVIN CANDIE
You don't hafta know why, do you
understand?

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.

CALVIN CANDIE
Good. They're spending the night. Go up
in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.

STEPHEN

(POINTING AT

DJANGO)
He's gonna stay in the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
In the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
You gotta problem with that?

STEPHEN
I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
and the pillow cases once this black ass
motherfuckers gone!

CALVIN CANDIE
That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
Your problem, right now, is making a
good impression. And I want you to start
solving that problem right now, and git
them rooms ready.
The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;

STEPHEN
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up
to her brother on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
Django,
(Django tips his hat)
and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.

Dr.SCHULTZ
And it is our great delight to encounter
this flaming rose.

LARA LEE
Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
You're not from around here, are you?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually I'm from a far off land,
Dusseldorf, to be exact.

CALVIN CANDIE
These two are in the market for a fightin'
nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
show 'em my stock.

LARA LEE
We'll all have dinner tonight, right?

CALVIN CANDIE
Half the reason I invited them. I thought
you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
little sister.
Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and
two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS
CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
You know since I started fightin' niggers
about eleven years ago, it's been a new
lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
now is the man responsible for all my
success.
Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and
Schultz.

CALVIN CANDIE
Howdy Ace.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
Ace Woody.
Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.

CALVIN CANDIE
And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
Cody.

(TO ACE)
Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
Django Freeman, they're big customers with
big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
brought 'em out here so you could give
'em a little display of our African flesh.
Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.

ACE WOODY
Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at
Django.
Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
Greenville to here.

ACE WOODY
These the new chickens?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob.

ACE WOODY
How many you get?

(HE COUNTS)
One, two, three, four, five.

CALVIN CANDIE
Five real strong bucks.

ACE WOODY
How many you get rid of?

CALVIN CANDIE
We still got three left.
Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
Leo Moguy chimes in;

MOGUY
I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
they'll be here tomorrow.
Ace turns to Brown.

ACE WOODY
Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
the pen till tomorrow.
Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into
the slave pen.
Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.

ACE WOODY
Y'all stand over there and make a line!
They do.
Ace climbs down from off his horse.
Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you think?

ACE WOODY
I think you lookin' for niggers to push
a plow, 'dem your boys.
Candie rolls his eyes.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's wrong with them?

ACE WOODY
Hold it...hold it, you done bought
r em, let me look at 'em.
Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.

ACE WOODY
Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
buy that one?

CALVIN CANDIE
Which one?

ACE WOODY
What you mean, which one? The one I'm
pointing at, that one.

CALVIN CANDIE
Actually, that one was purchased by
our mister Moguy.

ACE WOODY

(TO MOGUY)
You bought him?

MOGUY
Yes I did.

ACE WOODY
Why?

MOGUY
I like his prospects.

ACE WOODY
His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
Remind me again what prospects means?

MOGUY
Hope for the future.
Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
You got hope for his future?

MOGUY
I did.

ACE WOODY
Well I don't.
Ace walks over to the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
What's your name, boy?
The mandingo says;

SIDNEY JAMES
Sidney James, sir.

ACE WOODY
So long Sidney James.
Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
Sidney James point blank in the belly.
Everybody reacts.
Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
Ace looks up at his boss.

ACE WOODY
Boss Candie, which one did you buy?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well to me the pick of the litter is
Big Fred over there.

ACE WOODY

(POINTING AT

FRED)
This one over here?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You Fred?
A very scared Fred answers.

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody,
I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now
Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in
a kurfuffle?

CALVIN CANDIE
I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers
last night.

'ACE WOODY
How is of Amerigo?

CALVIN CANDIE
His nigger lost.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really? You won?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Wup'ed his ass?

CALVIN CANDIE
Beat 'em to death.
Smiling impressively at Big Fred.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really?

CALVIN CANDIE
He did have fifteen pounds on 'em,
but still, he still beat his ass
to death.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You did?

BIG FRED)
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
Candie acts out mock frustration.
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now why did you do that?

ACE WOODY
He won his last fight last night.
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos

ACE WOODY

(TO MANDINGOS)
Those of you with exceptional ability
will find it ain't so bad here. Those of
you who don't possess exceptional ability,
will wish you did.
Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.

ACE WOODY
Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin
push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em
in the head.

(TO MANDINGOS)
Welcome to Candyland, boys!
Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
Candie leans over to Schultz and says;

CALVIN CANDLE
We only get about two out of every batch
of five fighters we buy. But those two
tend to be lucky.
Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
that you don't trust my judgement?
Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;

ACE WOODY
Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
Boss Candie...eventually.
He rides off.
Stephen limps back to the action.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?

STEPHEN
All ready for your guest and his nigger.
Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're incorrigible.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your
rooms.

CALVIN CANDLE

(CON'T)
There you can lie down and rest up
for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
my finer specimens.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.

CALVIN CANDIE
Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
of oats.
Django hands the boy the reigns.

DJANGO
That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
care of 'em now.

TIMMY
Yes, sir.
Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.

DJANGO
Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.

DJANGO
Give that one to Fritz.
Timmy leads the horses away.
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
the nigger girl we were talking about?

CALVIN CANDIE
Nigger girl?

Dr.SCHULTZ
I believe you said she spoke German?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?
,oz.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you think before the demonstration you
could send her around to my room?

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't see why not.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.

STEPHEN
Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
somethin' we ain't tole you yet.

CALVIN CANDIE
What?

STEPHEN
Hildi's in The Hot Box.
This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's she doin' there?

STEPHEN
What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
she bein punished.

CALVIN CANDIE
What she do?

STEPHEN
She ran away again.

CALVIN CANDIE
Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
when I was gone?

STEPHEN
Two.

CALVIN CANDIE
When did she go?

STEPHEN
Last night. They brought her back this
morning.

CALVIN CANDLE
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
motherfuckers right now.

STEPHEN
Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
lookin' for her and found her. She a little
beat up, but she did that to herself.
Runnin' through them damn bushes.
Django's hand moves away from his gun.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long she been in the box?

STEPHEN
What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
fool got ten more days to go.

CALVIN CANDLE
Take her out.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
Take her out? Why!

CALVIN CANDLE
Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
hospitality dictates I make her available
to him.

STEPHEN
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

CALVIN CANDLE
Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
her out.
(to Cora and

LARA LEE)
Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
for getting her cleaned up and presentable
for Dr.Schultz?
The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box. While
Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.
Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
sizzling in it.
The HOT BOX
itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
men lift the heavy iron door open.
REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box
dug into the ground.
Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.

WHEN ...
Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
Django watches this.
DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.

REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS
as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
Stephen breaks the mood.

STEPHEN

(TO DJANGO)
You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
little box?
Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.

INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.

INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
lamp and a tiny bell on it.

STEPHEN
This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
nice too.
Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
rattles on in the background.

STEPHEN
Feel free to touch anything you want,
cause we burnin' all this shit once you
gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
door when the demonstration ready.
Django sits down on the bed.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Not so fast.

STEPHEN
I got more important things to do then
jaw with you.

DJANGO
Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.

DJANGO
This tiny bell on this little table...
.is this for you? I ring this, you
do fer me?

STEPHEN
Me or somebody.
Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
(a soft) DING-A-LING

STEPHEN

(UNAMUSED)
What 'cha want?

DJANGO
I want you to pour some water in that
bowl for my wash up.
Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.

)O'
Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.

DJANGO
Gimmie.
Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
Django takes it from him.
Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
that?
Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
knocking him to the floor;

DJANGO
That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
floor below his knees.

DJANGO
I've known me House Niggers like you my
whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
all the white folks think it's so cute.
Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
good side. Well this time Snowball, you
gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
you wanna sling my way, before they give
us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
give this whole motherfuckin plantation
a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
off your ass. I will make you drop your
drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
every nigga on this plantation. And after
I do that, let's see you play the rooster
round here.

X07

STEPHEN
Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.

DJANGO
Oh that's right, he gives you first name
privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
me again nigger, see what happen'.
Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.

DJANGO
That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
Before he leaves, Django tells him;,

DJANGO
When I ring this bell, you better come
a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
I'm on this property, you my nigger
Snowball.
Stephen leaves.
Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
Schultz stands there.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Was that wise?
Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.

DJANGO
He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
That's all that needs to be said.

INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
after Calvin's sister raps on it.
Dr.Schultz opens the door.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Hello ladies.

DOG

LARA LEE
Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
speaks German.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO BROOMHILDA)
I've been informed you do as well.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
in German.
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Astonishing.

(IN GERMAN)
Please come inside Fraulein.
She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
"Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.

INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON
With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
disoriented girl.
He gives her a pleasant smile.

Dr.SCHULTZ
They call you Hildi, but your real name
is Broomhilda, isn't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes. How do you know that?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Stands to reason who ever taught you
German would also give you a German name.
Can I pour you a glass of water,
Broomhilda?
Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
on the frightened girl.

WE CUT TO DJANGO
on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue
to present himself.
BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ
As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins
talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
I'm only speaking German to you now,
Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
listening to us. Myself and a mutual
friend of ours, have gone through a lot
of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
find you fraulein - to rescue you.
He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
She looks at him weird, rescue me?

Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Please drink.
She absentmindedly obeys.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(.GERMAN).
Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
intention to take you away from here
forever.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I don't got any friends.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Who?

Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
surprise you.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Where is he?
He points at the adjoining door.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Standing right behind that door.
Her head moves in the direction of the door.
He looks to the young woman;

Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Promise me you won't scream?
She nods her head, yes.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Say, I promise.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I promise.
Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
The door knob turns.
The door slowly opens revealing...
Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
He smiles at her, and says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
Obviously a pet name between them.
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
.first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and
the water spills on the floor ...
.followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint.
The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;

Dr.SCHULTZ
You silver tongued devil you.

MONTAGE
WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
vaguely optimistic ...
WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
continues over this scene.
Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
A study in powerless fury.

DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE
in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.

STEPHEN
What you. whistlin', girl?
Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.

STEPHEN
What was you whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
Oh nuttin'.

STEPHEN
You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
no.name.

)/Z

STEPHEN
It's kinder pretty.
She doesn't say anything in return.

STEPHEN
That was a compliment.

BROOMHILDA
Thank you.
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
you are two days later, whistlin' while you
work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
.I'm jus' sayin'.
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.

BROOMHILDA
I'm done here, may I be excused?

STEPHEN
Yes you may.
She moves off to another part of the house.
He watches her shuffle off.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
Domestic Slaves despise Django.
Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
specimens, no doubt about it. But the
best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
called Eskimo Joe?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
day he said he was cold.. .who knows?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
best, and you'll never sell him and I can
see why, he's a champion.

CALVIN CANDIE
All three are champions.
Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

DJANGO
Samson's the champion. The other two
are pretty good.
All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
contradict Calvin Candie.
Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
potatoes.

LARA LEE
Hildi!
Broomhilda snaps back.
Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
then issues his own appraisal;

CALVIN CANDIE
Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
long as you don't put 'em up against those
two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

DJANGO
Maybe.
The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.

F

Dr.SCHULTZ
You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
game, I do have a bit of a background in
the European traveling circus. Hence, I
have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
I need something more then just a big nigger.
He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
but is he right as rain ... ?
Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
sip of his mint julep, then says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
is no one in the nigger fight game that
appreciates the value of showmanship
more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
one must not forget the most important
thing in the nigger fight game.

(BEAT)
A nigger that can win fights. That should
be your first, second, third, four, and
fifth concern. After you have that, and
you know you have that, then, you can
start to implement a grande design. But
since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
status - beating Moguy by one year for
that honor allow the old sage to advise,
first things first.
Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
She smiles, and says something pleasant back.

CALVIN CANDIE
I see you two gettin' on?
Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;

Dr.SCHULTZ
.Famously.

(DRAMATIC PAUSE)
Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
it's like not to hear you native tongue
for four years.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
Everybody at the table chuckles.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I can't express the joy I felt conversing
in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
charming conversation companion.
As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.

LARA LEE
I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
the German sweet talk you want, but it
looks like this ponys got big eyes for
Django.
Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three,
Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.

AND ...
.STEPHEN sees it.
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the
kitchen.
Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
a drink in this house in twenty years.

STEPHEN
When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
a COLD drink.
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE
Did you overhear that joke I said about
me spending two weeks in Boston

STEPHEN

(MOCK INDIGNANT)
You don't have any idea the work I do
to see food gets on the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
What does that hafta do with the price of
Tea in China?

STEPHEN
You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got
nothin' better to do then listen in here
to you tellin' unfunny jokes?
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE

(MOCK INDIGNATION)
What? They laughed!

STEPHEN
Of course they laughed, their parents
raised them right. When they're a guest
in somebody's house, and the master of
of the house thinks he's- funny, you
suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
Chuckle... .chuckle...
They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.

CALVIN CANDIE
No it was really funny,

(TO TABLE)
wasn't it?

STEPHEN
Now what do you expect these people to
say? What you need to do is stop
embarrassing your guest.

(TO TABLE)
Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
polite, I understand, you mean well, but
it just encourages him.
Chuckle-chuckle...
As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.

TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks
eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.

STEPHEN
You know that nigger?
/ She spins around.

BROOMHILDA
Who?

STEPHEN
Don't stall me bitch, you know who?

BROOMHILDA
At the table? I don't know him.

STEPHEN.
You don't know him?

BROOMHILDA
No.

STEPHEN
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
She shakes her head, no.
Stephen looks at her skeptical.

STEPHEN
Okay, if you say so.

BACK TO DINNER TABLE
Pick it up again in mid-negotiation.

DJANGO
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
about it. But if it was my money, I
wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
for him.

Dr.SCHULTZ
What would your price be?

DJANGO
Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
and I don't know why I would be inclined
to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
Candie's lawyer chimes in.

MOGUY
But the real question is, not how much
he cost, but how much he can earn?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Django?

DJANGO
In a years time, seven or eight fights -
outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland
pedigree weren't well known - Virginia...

(CON'T)

DJANGO

(CON'T)
Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
one thousand dollars.

CALVIN CANDIE
Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
you cut that cake, that spells profit.
Not to, mention a years worth of action at
the big table in a blood sport with a
winner nigger. However let me reclarify
how this whole negotiation came about.
It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
nigger, it was you who approached me to
buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,
ain't too far off from right. And if I
wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
could sell 'em any day of the week.
But like you said in Greenville doctor,
I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
dollars that would make me consider it.
Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;

Dr.SCHULTZ
You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
the power of persuasion.
Candie smiles at that remark.
Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;

Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
The White people at the table get very happy.
Dr.Schultz continues;

Dr.SCHULTZ
However, that is a tremendous amount of
money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
up a legal contract before I would feel
comfortable exchanging that amount of
money for flesh. Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
choosing. So say I return in about five
days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
the finer points between themselves.

CALVIN CANDIE
Splendid.

(CALLING TO

THE KITCHEN)
Stephen, time for dessert!
Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the
kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
Broomhilda goes to Calvin.

BROOMHILDA
Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may, Hildi.
She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
Candie looks up at her as she works.

CALVIN CANDIE
So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
table in the big house?

BROOMHILDA
I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a lot better then sizzling in that
hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
bramble bush, ain't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes 'em.
With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
Stephen clocks this.
Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.

STEPHEN
You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
where he from.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
just speak German, or did ya git her
clothes off?

Dr.SCHULTZ
We just spoke.

CALVIN CANDIE
So you haven't seen her back?

Dr.SCHULTZ
No I haven't.

CALVIN CANDIE
Then Stephen's right, you would probably
find this interesting. Hildi, take off
your dress, and show us your back.
Django hears this.
Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
Stephen clocks it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
and looking nice.

CALVIN CANDIE
But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
they don't got niggers there. And he's a
man of medicine. I'm sure it would
fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
pain. I mean Hildi got something like
fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
are tough, no doubt about it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
Django continues to watching this play out.
Stephen watches him.
Candie folds.

CALVIN CANDIE
Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
During the brandies.
Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
kitchen.
Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
the kitchen door.

INT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;

STEPHEN
I thought you said you didn't know him?
Broomhilda turns around.

BROOMHILDA
Huh?
Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.

STEPHEN
I said, you said, you didn't know him?

BROOMHILDA
I don't.

STEPHEN
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA
Mister Stephen, I don't.

STEPHEN
Why you lyin to me?
As tears begin to well in her eyes.

BROOMBILDA
I ain't.

STEPHEN
Why you cryin'?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scarin' me.

STEPHEN
Why am I scarin' you?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scary.
Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner
table conversation begins to bleed inside.
We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;

Dr.SCHULTZ (OS)
.to speak German,with Hildi this
afternoon was positively soul enriching.
Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.
His eyes to to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
You, stay in the kitchen.
Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's
just figured it out.

INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT

Dr.SCHULTZ
You indicated earlier you would be
willing to part with Hildi?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob I did.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case allow me to propose
another proposition?
In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
- Monsieur Candie?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
(to Dr.Schultz)
Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
ain't worth a damn these days.

(TO CANDIE)
Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
the kitchen.

CALVIN CANDIE
What, you mean get outta my chair?

STEPHEN
If you could manage it. It's about dessert.

CALVIN CANDIE
What about dessert?

STEPHEN
I would rather tell you in private.

CALVIN CANDIE
We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
melodrama could be brewing back there?
Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;

STEPHEN
Meet me in the library.
Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
library" is their secret signal.

CALVIN CANDIE
Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
Stephen exits.
Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
they are in the kitchen, from time to
time, adult supervision is required.
If you'll excuse me a moment.
Candie exits.

TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on
the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red
leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his
brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and
Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of
outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk
turkey.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's the matter?

STEPHEN
Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
mandingos. They want that girl. -

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell you talkin' about?

STEPHEN
They playin your ass for a fool, that's
what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
that girl.

CALVIN CANDIE
What girl, Hildi?

STEPHEN
Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.

CALVIN CANDIE
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

STEPHEN
Did he give you any money?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well not yet, but -

STEPHEN
- Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
how. But he was just about to buy, who he
came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.

CALVIN CANDIE
Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
go through all that trouble, to. buy a
nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
five hundred dollars?

STEPHEN
Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
Now why that German gives a fuck about
who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
with, I'm sure I don't know.

CALVIN CANDIE
If she's who they want, why the whole
snake oil pitch about mandingos?

STEPHEN
Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
to four hundred dollar. But twelve
thousand got you real friendly.
Calvin thinks ...
.as per usual, Stephen's right.

CALVIN CANDIE
Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin'
sonsabitches!

(LOUDER)
Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
.gonna have us a Candyland tar and
feathering!

FL5

STEPHEN
Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
seein' something like that ... . but why
don't you sit down and let's talk about this.

CALVIN CANDLE
I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
huckster insinuate themselves at my
dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
plantation for a fool!

STEPHEN
Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
discuss this.
A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.

STEPHEN
Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
was something up with these two. We just
didn't know what. But now we do. They
don't want you to know how bad they want
that girl. But these ole boys have rode
a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
bull to get this girl. They must want her
mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
changed is the advantage.

(BEAT)
Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
and busts these motherfucker's chops.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court
melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the
kitchen door.
Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon

SEEING HIM;

LARA LEE
There you are! I was beginning to think
you and that of crow ran off together.
Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
stares down the table at them.

CALVIN CANDLE
That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
Lara Lee?

(CON'T)

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
Would you be a dear and go out there and
give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and
Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
your shoulder?
Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun
pointing at them.
Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
he's holding a big ugly hammer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
They put their palms on the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now you lift those palms off that turtle
shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
There's been a lotta lies said around this
table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.

(BEAT)
Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
Mr.Moguy does.
Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
were just getting ready to make me a
proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Right.

CALVIN CANDIE

(YELLING TO

STEPHEN)
Stephen! Bring out Hildi!
Ix?
Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol
against the side of her head.
Django and Schultz react.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now it should be quite clear by now I know
you're not here to buy no mandingos.
Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
horseshit.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, put her in that chair.
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
silently watch Candie's next move.
Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
myself said, "What is your definition of
ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
thousand dollars."
Now considering you two have ridden a whole
lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I take it you prefer the take it or leave
it style of negotiating.
Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
anything with my property I so desire.
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
everybody jump.

IN

CALVIN CANDIE
And if you think my price for this nigger
is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.

Dr.SCHULTZ
May I lift my hands from the table top in
order to remove my billfold?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may.
Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
jacket, and says;,

Dr.SCHULTZ
Easy come, easy go.
He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at
the seated Schultz, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Pleasure doin' business with you.

TIME CUT

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
.Moguy signs as a witness.
Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
freedom papers.
Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and
Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a
thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
dollars- for twelve thousand.
Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz
around pouring coffee for the white people.
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
rhubarb pie with him.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Rhubarb pie?
Schultz looks at the pie and the man.

Dr.SCHULTZ
No.

CALVIN CANDIE
Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
of ya?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually, I was thinking of that poor
devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
all this.
Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
examines he papers.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dumas...?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
I figured you must be an admirer. You named
your slave after that novel's lead character.
If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
wonder what he would of made of it?

CALVIN CANDIE
You doubt he'd approve?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
at best.

CALVIN CANDIE
Soft hearted Frenchy?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas is black.
Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two
companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;

Dr.SCHULTZ
We got it, let's go.

(TO CANDIE)
Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is, till I see you again,
and since I never wish to see you again,
to you sir, I say, goodbye.
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
When Calvin says to the German's back;

CALVIN CANDIE
One more moment, Doc!

Dr.SCHULTZ
What?

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a custom here in the South, once a
business deal is concluded, for the two
parties to shake hands. It implies good
faith.

Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not from the South.
He turns to leave.

CALVIN CANDIE
You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
I must insist.
This turns Schultz around.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Insist what...? That I shake your hand
before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
insist in the opposite direction.
Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know what I think you are?

Dr.SCHULTZ
What you think I am? No I don't.

CALVIN CANDLE
I think you are a bad loser.

Dr.SCHULTZ
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

CALVIN CANDLE
Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
a deal ain't done till the two parties have
shook hands. Even after all this paper
signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.

Dr.SCHULTZ
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
away twelve thousand dollars...?
I don't think so.
Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Let's go.

CALVIN CANDIE
Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
before this German shakes my hand.
Cut 'er down.
Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
.and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks

CANDLE;

Dr.SCHULTZ.
You really want me to shake your hand?
Django gets it.

CALVIN CANDIE
I insist.

DR
-Schultz smiles.

Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, if you insist.
Django goes to stop him...
The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...

POP!
He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he
falls to the floor.
Everybody is stunned.
Schultz looks to Django.
Django looks back.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

FADE TO BLACK
We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.

INT - BARN - AFTERNOON
Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face
with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
Django begins to come to ...

TIMMY

(SHHH'S HIM)
Act like you still sleepin'.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

TIMMY
Who?

DJANGO
Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
couple of days ago. They had her in The
Hot Box.

TIMMY
I don't know 'bout no girl.

DJANGO
How 'bout that German white man I came
here with?

TIMMY
Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of
the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
bucket at the fleeing boy.

ACE WOODY
Git on outta here, boy!
Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.

ACE WOODY
So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
Django thinks, "How does he know?"

ACE WOODY
I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
We found your wanted posters and book of figures
in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
line of work?
Django retorts, upside down.

DJANGO
Well, it turns out I was a natural.
Ace woody laughs.

ACE WOODY
Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
length from the hanging man.

ACE WOODY
See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
everyone 'round here blames you.
Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.

ACE WOODY
Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
able to attend.
Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
. IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
Django's face.
Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
As he does this, he says;

ACE WOODY
Now I understand you didn't really have
nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
But grieving folks 'round here need someone
to blame. And I guess they figure if you
hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
And you know what, they got a point.
He THROWS the knife again...
.this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
As he does he says;

ACE WOODY
Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
the error of his ways, believe me when I.
tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
there try an' git creative with the way they
bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
methods are, tried and true.
He THROWS the knife again...
Django JERKS his head back ...
.and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
mercy.

ACE WOODY
You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
money I made my whole goddamn life.
And no end in sight, neither.

(BEAT)
Then you came along. Knocked me right off
that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
mandingos as her brother?
Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
is you done fucked up my good thang.
So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
could say I gotta axe to grind.

IJS
He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack.
Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.

ACE WOODY
How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
Django dances some more ...

ACE WOODY
Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.

(BREATH)
On the count of three.

DJANGO SCREAMS:

DJANGO

NO!!!!

ACE WOODY

ONE ...

DJANGO

NO DON'T DO IT!!!!!

ACE WOODY
Got to do it, boy. TWO...

DJANGO

NO!!!! !
Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm.

STEPHEN
Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
talk about the Old Man's funeral.
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
Dickey people.
While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;

ACE WOODY
Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion
of what almost happened.

ACE WOODY

(TO DJANGO)
How disappointing.

ACE WOODY

(TO STEPHEN)
Where she at?

STEPHEN
She in the big house. The kitchen.
Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the
blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in
the fire.
Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.

ACE WOODY
You gonna look after our friend?
As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;

STEPHEN
Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
upside down nigger we both know, gonna
have us a big of chat.
He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END

GLOWS ORANGE.

STEPHEN
Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
stick is all nice and FROSTY.
Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
alone.
With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
hanging Django.

STEPHEN
I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
You get the idea to go to Greenville -
look up the Ole Man there.

(BREATH)
That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
Big House.

STEPHEN

(BEAT)
And that's where you met me. And that's when
you knew your goose was cooked.
He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
tip of that red hot poker.

STEPHEN
Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
didn't know what's what. He still thought his
ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
you are, you always know the end is near
'fore the white folks.
With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
breathing it in his nostrils.

STEPHEN
Damn Nigger, you smell good.
He walks behind Django with the poker.

STEPHEN
You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
bed in the quest room in the Big House -
After you slapped my ass to the floor
You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
Remember that, Bright Boy?
He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
buttocks.
Django SCREAMS!
Stephen LAUGHS.
Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
the floor by the hanging man.

STEPHEN
You leavin', that's what you can take
with you.
Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.

I31

STEPHEN
Now you were quite the topic of conversation
for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
never had a bright idea in their life, was
comin' up with different ways to kill your
ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
"Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
"Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
worse then that."
He stops massaging Django's balls.

STEPHEN
So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
Like them three y'all came back with. For them
big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
I give two or three.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

STEPHEN
She's all right for now. Miss Lara
soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
Now Billy Crash might not look or
smell too good, but ain't nobody
gonna bother her.
Stephen limps away.

CUT TO

EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON
The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding
up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a
prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a
2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

ROY
It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
the big boss. Let's git the niggers and
git out.
The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.
and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.

FLOYD
You blacks line up.
They do.

FLOYD
What's your names?

CHESTER
Chester.

CHICKEN CHARLY
Chicken Charly.

RODNEY
Rodney.

FLOYD
I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.

(POINTING AT

CHESTER'S BUNDLE)
What's that?

CHESTER
It's my stuff.

FLOYD
Throw it in the dirt.
All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt.

FLOYD
(to Chicken Charly)
You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
(to all three)
You are now the property of The LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace
Woody call out;

ACE WOODY (OS)
Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
for ya.
Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his
old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.

ROY
We can't use that skinny bastard.

ACE WOODY
We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
punishment niggers from time to time.

ROY
No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.

ACE WOODY
Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.

ROY
Look, no one tole' me 'bout -

ACE WOODY
- No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
how and why you fucked up our nice little
business relationship, take this nigger and
hush up about it!

ROY
Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.

"H
Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
Django stops Ace Woody.

DJANGO
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
with them. They'll kill me. What about all
that -turning big rocks into little rocks-
shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
but I didn't think that was the idea.
Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.

ACE WOODY
He can't go in there with them.

FLOYD
Why not?

ACE WOODY
They'll kill him.

FLOYD
I don't give a damn.

ACE WOODY
Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
we want the mine to grind him to gravel!

ROY
Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
black and make sure he keeps up.

JANO
Oh, I'll keep 'em up.
Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the other end
around his saddle horn.
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland.

EXT - MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County.
Stoic Roy riding lead horse, Floyd driving the cage wagon, Rodney,
Chester, and Chicken Charly bouncing around inside the cage wagon, Jano
riding horses ass, and Django being led on foot behind him.

DJANGO

(TO JANO)
Hey boy!
Jano ignores him.

DJANGO
I said, hey white boy!

JANO
Keep your mouth shut black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.

DJANGO
What's he pay you?

JANO
Who?

DJANGO
LeQuint Dickey?

JANO
You gotta few more things to worry about
black boy, then what I get paid.

DJANGO
I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious.
I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey
Mining Company, ain't I?

JANO
Yeah.

DJANGO
And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, dont'cha?

JANO
Yeah?

DJANGO
Well, I know how much I'm gettin' paid,
how much you gettin' paid? I mean like
for instance, how much you gettin' paid
for today?

JANO
Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey
paid for our passage from Australia to here.
We get a little money to send back home, and
pay him back for the boat trip.

I"

DJANGO
How long you been here?

JANO
'bout two years.

DJANGO
And you ain't paid him back yet?

JANO

(DEFENSIVELY)
No, not yet!

DJANGO

(LAUGHS)
You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought
your ass for the price of a boat ride.
At least they didn't charge us for our boat
ride ... . ha ha ha ha...

JANO

(YELLING)
You shut up!
Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
Django, when the black man says to him;

DJANGO
How'd you like to make eleven thousand
dollars?

JANO
What?
Django steps closer to him.

DJANGO
How would you like to make eleven thousand
dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred,
actually?
Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;

ROY
Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black,
and keep up!

DJANGO
Keep riding, just ride slower.
They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.

R44

DJANGO
Back at that plantation Candyland, there
was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode
right past it.

JANO
You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.

DJANGO
That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
earn it.

JANO
If you got something to say, say it.

DJANGO
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

JANO
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
dollars for each of his three accomplices,
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
cause they just got away with murder.

(BEAT)
But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
mates could get that money.

JANO
Who pays the money?

DJANGO
The Court.

JANO
The Court?

DJANGO
The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
the way, the court don't give a damn about
how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the
back, from up on a hill, in the back of
the head, in their sleep - don't matter.

(CON'T)

DJANGO

(CON'T)
Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
long as you do it.

JANO
They.pay us to kill 'em?

DJANGO
No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
corpse. Get it?

JANO
I think so... . what did these jokers do again?

DJANGO
Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.
Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck.
He hands it to Jano.

JANO
What's this?

DJANGO
I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty
Bacall and The Bacall Gang.
Jano looks at the handbill.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter, can't you read?

JANO
I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.

DJANGO
What about that cowboy fella in the lead?

JANO
Roy?

DJANGO
Can Roy read?

JANO
Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin
read. I just don't got my glasses.

CUT TO
EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to
the side of the road.

IN THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through
the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of
what they're watching.
What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't
hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a
piece of paper.

INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL
Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.

DJANGO
I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
Candyland on a horse with my white German
partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
blame me, so here I am.

(TO ROY)
You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
But those four men, are still back there.
They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
and gittin it.
Django is damn convincing.

ROY
What's your deal? You tell us who they are
and we let ya go?

DJANGO
I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
and I'll point 'em out to you.
He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
one little push.

DJANGO
Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
me in the same cage with them without them
killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
.am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?

CUT TO

ROY AND FLOYD
go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk,
Roy continues to study the handbill.

ROY

(READING ALOUD)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
One thousand five hundred dollars for each
of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.

FLOYD
Just because the handbill's real doesn't
mean that other bunch of malarky.is.

ROY
Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
or alive handbill in his pocket?
Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.

ROY
That black's damn convincing.
They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;

ROY
(pointing, behind
him, at Django)
That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points
the barrel at the cage.

ROY
I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
he ride in with a white man yesterday?

CHESTER
Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
Auction and he rode on a horse with a
white man.

ROY
This white man, was the black his slave?

RODNEY
He weren't no slave.

FLOYD
You sure about that?

RODNEY
Damn sure.
Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
seriously.

ROY
What happened at Candyland?

CHICKEN CHARLY
Bunch of shootin, master got shot.

ROY
Who shot 'em?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The German.

ROY
And why did he do that?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The nigger and the German were actin as if they
were slavers, but they weren't.

ROY
What were they?

RODNEY
Bounty hunters.
Floyd is starting to get convinced.

FLOYD
Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
(to the Slaves)
Do you know who Smitty Bacall is?

!Y,

ROY
(barking at Floyd)
They wouldn't go by their outlaw names
you idiot!

CUT TO
Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.

ROY
Okay black, you gotta deal.
Jano reacts.

DJANGO
I got one more condition.

ROY
What?

DJANGO
When we get there, when the time comes,
you let me help you kill 'em.
Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists.

ROY

(LAUGHING)
You got a deal, black.
Django interrupts -

DJANGO
You gotta deal, mate.
Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies.

ROY
You're all right for a black fella!

THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men
cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them
all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"

BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET

ROY
We'll give you that pack horse.

DJANGO
What's them saddle bags filled with?

FLOYD
Dynamite.
!so

DJANGO
I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
dynamite on his back!

ROY

(CHUCKLE CHUCKLE)
Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
cage.
Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this
at all.
Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's
horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The
Cage Wagon.
Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;

DJANGO
Where's my pistol?

ROY
Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
'em your gun and your belt.
Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over
to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;

FLOYD
Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
fixed last month, it's perfect.
Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.

DJANGO
That's good to know.
Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
in the chest...
Roy turns around...
Django takes the gun out of the holster...
. BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
dead.
Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!
Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS...
The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
The CAGE WAGON
Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the
blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in
the air, obscuring all visibility...

THEN ...
A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
REVEALING in bright color focus...
.DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
Jano.
He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
wrapped around his waist.
He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
and climbs aboard him bareback.
He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
next to him.
Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
horses bring the best out of Django.
From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

.THEN...
Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
cage door.
He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

DJANGO
Throw up that dynamite.
Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
his Horse.
Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.
The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.
"Who was that nigger?"

CUT TO
l.rz
A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from
the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of
Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on
'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers,
Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best
mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress,
wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora)
crying at her side.

CORA
The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur
Candie think it real nice.

LARA LEE
Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora.

WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS
of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare
backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one
hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a
gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian.

EXT - TRACKER SHACK/BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET
The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack
-Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share.
The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel
next to the bunkhouse.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse
wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a
mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of
your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS"
(yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice
that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small
delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making.

EXT - WOODS-OUTSIDE THE SHACK - SUNSET
INSERT: HORSE HOOFS walking then stopping. Django's bare feet jump on
to the ground.

INT - DOG KENNEL - SUNSET
The FOUR DOGS lay out... . when, Marsha hears something, and raises her
head...

SHIRTLESS DJANGO
moves quietly through the woods.

MARSHA
rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three
PALS continue to lay out.

DJANGO BY A TREE
he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the
chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way.

MARSHA

BARK!
The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert.
Django disappears.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
They hear the barking inside.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Jake!
Jake building his birdhouse.

JAKE
Yeah?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Check on Marsha.
Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to
check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).

EXT - TRACKER SHACK
As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.

JAKE
opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of
him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...

DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE...

JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.
After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
attack.
Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
to take Stonesipher's ass out.
This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
each other for their life.
Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
That weakens Stonesipher.
He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
That puts the mountain man down on his back.
He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
The Trackers are all dead.
Only the dogs mad barking remains.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The Funeral for Calvin Candie is underway. The Preacher reads some
words over him.

EXT - TRACKER SHACK - NIGHT
Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps
out of the shack. He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks
over to the WATER PUMP.
Marsha and her three friends-continue to BARK like mad.
He PUMPS a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. He
begins washing the blood-off'of himself. As he washes, he says outloud;

DJANGO
What ya doin around here, boy?
Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes.

TIMMY
I was just walkin' by.

DJANGO
Wanna help me out?

TIMMY
Sure.

DJANGO
My woman, Hildi, is with Billy Crash.
You know where his shack is?

TIMMY
Sure do.

DJANGO
You show me?

TIMMY
Will I get in trouble?

DJANGO
Not by the time I get through killin'
everybody.
Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. He believes him.

TIMMY
I'll show ya.

THEN ...
Django turns towards the barking dogs. He turns back to Timmy and asks;

DJANGO
You know what toadstools look like?

15-C

TIMMY
Sure do.

DJANGO
Go pick me a mess of 'em.
INSERT: TIMMY picking TOADSTOOLS (POISON MUSHROMS).
INSERT: DJANGO stirring a big pot of BEEF STEW with a wooden spoon in
the tracker shack.
Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS
the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and
mixes it up with the spoon.

EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up
the stew.
Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.

DJANGO
You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.

DJANGO
First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.

EXT - FUNERAL NIGHT
The funeral is in full melodramatic bore.

TNT - STABLE-BLACKSMITH - NIGHT
Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.

DJANGO
Saddle up Fritz and Tony.
Timmy just stares.

DJANGO
Now, boy!
Timmy hops to work.
Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a
holster around his ankle.
As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;

TIMMY
Do you feel bad for your friend?
Django rises from the body of his friend.

DJANGO
Yeah, "I do.
As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

TIMMY
I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
friend once. He drowned in the lake.
Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
understand.
He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
And finally his hat.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The service is over, everybody is hugging each other and holding hands,
and beginning to leave.

INT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
Billy Crash is in bed fucking Broomhilda. She doesn't wail, she doesn't
make any whimpering sounds, but her eyes constantly water.
As Billy's fucking her he says;

BILLY CRASH
It's gonna be real nice 'round here now
the 'ol man's gone.

BILLY CRASH

He stops fucking in frustration

BROOMHILDA
I can't.

BILLY CRASH
Now girl, I'm tryin' to be nice.

BROOMHILDA
I can't help it! I'm really sad!
He hops off her and yells at her.

BILLY CRASH
Well goddamit, you're a nigger! Life is sad
for niggers! Git use to it!

(CALMING DOWN)
Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster
from way back. But you know I've always been
sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass.
So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit.
You calm down.
He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.
WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for
Django, she cries for herself...

.THEN...
She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy
Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground.
Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the
front door.

CU BROOMHILDA
Her face, stained with tears, watches the door.
A soft "Knock Knock" on the door.

BROOMHILDA

(SOFTLY)
Yes?
The VOICE on the other side of the door, says;

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
She hops out of bed, and throws open the door...

THERE HE IS,
she runs into his arms.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The TWO OLD SLAVE.GRAVE DIGGERS are throwing the first shovelfuls of
dirt on Monsieur Calvin J. Candie's coffin.
The participants of this ritual, begin to move away from the grave. The
funeral is a private affair, just the Candie Family Unit, some of the
overseers, and the slaves. No one from town, except the Preacher.
The SLAVE MOURNERS begin. to move towards their living area, all saying
goodbye to Miss Lara. Miss Lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to
them.
A little cognizant of the Candie Family unit begin the walk off the
hill back to the big house.

EXT - BILLY CRASH'S SHACK - NIGHT
Django with Broomhilda. Billy Crash lies dead in the B.G., Stonesipher's
Buck Knife buried deep in his chest. He hands Broomhilda her papers.

DJANGO
Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers.
No matter what happens to me, hold on to these
and get out of the south.

BROOMHILDA
What's gonna happen to you?

DJANGO
Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey,
I'm just sayin'. Now go to the stable, little
Timmy's got our horses .saddled. Your horse is
named Fritz. He's a damn fine horse. Meet me
around the side of the big house.

BROOMHILDA
But what about you -

DJANGO
- Don't worry about me. I'll see you, with
Timmy and the horses, by the big house.
He sends her on her way.
Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking
down hill heading back for the big house.
EXT - The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE - NIGHT
The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk
back to The Big House for a drink. This Candie Family Unit consists of:
LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress.

The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.
CUE cool MUSIC.
STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them.
ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it.
The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun
around his waist.
Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
.it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.
The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO

OUTFIT.
STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and
JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's
standing there.
He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down
at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester
rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by
the gun on his hip.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of
Wonder, Fear, and Hate.

ICZ

WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA
as she watches this.
As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big
House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him.
The black man in the cool green jacket says;

DJANGO
I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody?
You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that
niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right?

ACE WOODY
I guess I shoulda'.

DJANGO
Yes you should of.
He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass.

DJANGO
Everybody stand up!
It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.
Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie
Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred.

THEN...
He tosses the rifle away.
Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a

SHOWDOWN STANCE.
EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions.
Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps
at the ten people, and says;

DJANGO
All black folks, take ten steps away from
the white folks.
DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him.

DJANGO
Not you Stephen. You're right where you
belong.
The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten
steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her.
CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger."
DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of
his pocket.

DJANGO

(TO STEPHEN)
Let's see if you can handle this as well
as you can my nuts?
He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun.

DJANGO

(TO EVERYBODY)
Somebody give Miss Lara a gun.
BROWN gives LARA LEE one. of his two guns.

BROWN

(TO DJANGO)
Can I at least cock it for her?

DJANGO
Yep.
BROWN cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker, and puts it in her hand,
and points it towards the ground.

BROWN
(to Lara Lee)
Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till
the shootin' starts. Then bring it up as
fast as you can.
LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLI can't come to grips with what she's.in the
middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about to
happen.

DJANGO
(to the six)
Make your play hillbillies.
The MUSIC SWELLS.

16'F
EVERYBODY, except for LARA LEE is READY:

DJANGO ACE WOODY

STEPHEN MOGUY

BROWN CODY

LARA LEE
The PEOPLE watching on the side:

BARTHOLOMEW SAMSON BROOMHILDA

CORA GOLDIE TIMMY
EVERYONE'S ready, but no one wants to start this party...

TILL...
ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN starts
to raise his Derringer.
But it's no contest.
As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his left hand
FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White People (and
Stephen) standing in front of him.
They all fall to grass in different ways..
It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't know
HOW GOOD DJANGO was.

FLASH ON
DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE MARKSMANSHIP
to Dr.Schultz.

Dr.SCHULTZ

(SMILING)
You know what they're going to call you,
my boy? "The fastest gun in the South."

BACK TO SHOWDOWN
DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House, looking
down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
Candyland front lawn.
The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.
All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are still
alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
DJANGO sees this.
The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
It EXPLODES.
Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
blowing the limbs off of many of them.
The LAWN is SILENT.
DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

BROOMHILDA
Hey Big Trouble Maker.

DJANGO
Down, boy.
Timmy hops off of Tony.
Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;

DJANGO
I tole' you ain't nuttin' gonna happen
to me.

BROOMHILDA
Yes you did.

DJANGO
Girl, you're gonna hafta start trustin' me.

BROOMHILDA
I'll keep that in mind.
Django looks down to Timmy.

DJANGO
Thanks for the help, boy.
He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and tosses it
down to Timmy.

DJANGO
That's for you. Good luck Tim.
(he points to
the Northern Sky)
The North star, is that one.
He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.

DJANGO
You gonna hafta keep up, ya know?

BROOMHILDA
You won't wait for me.

DJANGO
Better not.

BROOMHILDA
You won't.

DJANGO

(SMILING)
Better not.

BROOMHILDA

(SMILING)
You won't.
They kiss.
Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
Dragons.

THE END
FADE IN:
MAIN TITLES

As presentation credits begin, we hear Johnny Cash's "Home 
of the Blues." Then we see Allison's name, under it Alex's, 
under that Robert's, under that Quentin's, then under that 
the title logo for Four Rooms, followed by "Starring Tim 
Roth as the Bellboy." Then "The Guests" listed in alphabetical 
order of all the actors playing guests. After the actors' 
names, we...

FADE UP ON A WALL

The camera pans down a weathered wall covered with postcards 
from Miami Beach, Florida, the Copacabana, N.Y.C., "Wish You 
Were Here" from Niagara Falls, rickshaws and babes on beaches, 
etc....

The camera comes to rest on an old photograph of a 1930s 
hotel, the "Mon Signor," in its heyday, with a full staff of 
30 people posed on the lawn in front.

An old guy with a staccato voice delivers a monologue:

VOICE-OVER
There used to be a staff of fifty in 
this place. I'm the only one left 
from those days. It all comes down 
to one sap: the night-shift bellhop, 
that's me. What the hell is a bellhop? 
You know where the name comes from?
(silence)
Of course not... It's so simple it's 
stupid. They ring a bell and you 
hop. You hop to front and center. No 
heroes in this line, kid. Just men 
doing a job. No questions asked, 
none answered. I try to keep it 
simple, kid, not too personal...

Another voice of a young man interrupts.

TED
You met any of those old stars?

THE OLD GUY
Stars! Are you kidding me? I took 
Rin Tin Tin out for a shit, for 
Christ's sakes. I taught Shirley 
Temple how to roller-skate. I saw 
Fatty Arbuckle regurgitate three 
cheese sandwiches right on the spot 
you're sitting, kid. What did you 
say your name was?

TED
Ted.

THE OLD GUY
Ted, right. I remember Marilyn used 
to come down at night and doze off 
in the kitchen. She liked the sound 
of the fans out back spinning around. 
Sure, these were stars, kid. Errol 
Flynn used to call me "Alibi." You'll 
pick up a few stories yourself, kid.

TED
I don't think so, not like yours.

THE OLD GUY
What do you think a star does when 
he goes to the bathroom, kid?

TED
Beats me.

THE OLD GUY
He pulls his pants down and takes a 
crap just like you and me. Take my 
word for it.

A wisp of smoke passes over a napkin pinned to the wall with 
a lip print on it signed "Marilyn." The camera pulls back to 
reveal Ted and the Old Guy sitting on a foldout cot in a 
small back room of the Hotel Mon Signor. The old man is 
dressed in a striped T-shirt with a bellhop's cap on. He 
looks like an old pirate. Next to him on the bed sits Ted, a 
young guy with a bellhop jacket draped over his knees. The 
old bellhop takes a long drag off a big cigar.

THE OLD GUY
Camacho!

TED
Who?

THE OLD GUY
The cigar. Cuban. A good cigar, 
wrapped in Miami. I get a box of 
them every Christmas from the chairman 
of the board. I think he sends them 
to me to keep my mouth shut. It's 
tough not to get a little personal 
in this business.

The old bellhop takes a hit off his cigar and stares down at 
his cap, lost in thought.

TED
What do you mean?

The old guy passes the cap over to Ted.

THE OLD GUY
Put it on.

Ted puts the cap on.

THE OLD GUY
Frankly, you look stupid... like the 
Philip Morris guy. I can't believe I 
wore that thing for fifty years. You 
keep it.

The Old Guy gets up from the bed and throws a jacket on. 
Pulls a few postcards off the wall, throws them in an old 
straw suitcase, and slams the lid down. He heads for the 
door. Ted follows.

THE OLD GUY
Stay away from night clerks, kids, 
hookers, and marital disputes.

The Old Guy pauses for a second and looks Ted dead in the 
eye.

THE OLD GUY
Never have sex with the clientele.

TED
No way, not me. You got any other 
advice.

THE OLD GUY
Always get a tip.

The door slams shut on the back room.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY--TWILIGHT

The big empty lobby of the Mon Signor. You can tell that at 
one point this used to be a swank place. It still is, kinda. 
It's also kinda decrepit. The concierge -- a snappy, fast-
talking, red-haired young woman in a blue blazer named Betty -- 
stands behind the reception desk. The old man, suitcase in 
hand, makes a beeline through the lobby, heading toward the 
front door. Betty sees him.

BETTY
Sam! Hey, Sam, wait a minute!

The Old Guy stops in his tracks and turns around.

THE OLD GUY
What?

Betty comes from behind the desk.

BETTY
I just want to say good-bye.

THE OLD GUY
Who are you?

BETTY
Uhhh, Betty. The concierge. Your 
boss.

The Old Guy squints his eyes at the young gal.

THE OLD GUY
Oh yeah. Gotta light, sister? Goddam 
cigar went out.

BETTY
Yeah, sure.

She speaks to the Old Guy as she lights his cigar and he 
puffs away.

BETTY
I just want you to know, from the 
owner and all the staff, your fifty 
years of service have been an 
inspiration to us all. You're a legend 
in your own time, and the Mon Signor 
will never be the --

THE OLD GUY
Just forward my cigars, Red.
(He turns around the 
walks out, saying 
over his shoulder)
Aufwiedersehen!

Betty is left standing in the lobby. Ted appears behind her 
in his bellbody uniform, sans cap.

TED
Sam the bellboy. Now there was a 
man.

BETTY
Yeah. Oh, hi, Teddy. Ready to start 
the night shift?

TED
Yeah.

BETTY
Well, let me buy you a drink.

TED
You wanna buy me a drink? I'm starting 
my shift.

BETTY
You're not an alcoholic, are you; 
one drink won't kill you.

TED
Yeah, sure.

They walk out of frame. In the empty frame we

SUPER: NEW YEAR'S EVE 7:00 P.M.

INT. BACK ROOM--NIGHT

Betty and Ted sit in the back room, both with drinks in their 
hand. This dialogue is to be delivered rapid fire, Howard 
Hawks style.

BETTY
After fifty years, Sam retires, and 
you're taking over the night shift.

TED
Correct.

BETTY
You're filling some mighty big shoes.

TED
Oh, I know.

BETTY
Sam was a legend in the hotel 
business.

TED
Oh, I know...

BETTY
A bellhop's bellhop.

TED
An inspiration to us all.

BETTY
He ran the night desk for fifty years, 
all by himself.

TED
An amazing man.

BETTY
No desk clerk. No night man. No help. 
Just fuckin' Sam, and his wits.

TED
A man alone.

BETTY
And you're gonna do the same.

TED
I know.

BETTY
Tonight.

Ted spews his drink.

TED
Tonight!

BETTY
Yes, tonight.

TED
I can't.

BETTY
Yes, you can.

TED
No, I can't. I never worked the night 
shift before.

BETTY
Oh night shift -- smight shift.

TED
We were supposed to work it together.

BETTY
I know, but I can't.

TED
Why not?

BETTY
I'm having a New Year's Eve party.

TED
Since when?

BETTY
Actually, I'm not having it. My 
roommate is. And there's this guy. 
German guy. He's gonna be there. And 
so am I.

TED
I can't run this place by myself.

BETTY
Oh, sure ya can.

TED
No, I can't.

BETTY
Sam ran this place by himself for 
fifty years.

TED
Yeah, and he had fifty years of 
fuckin' practice, too. I haven't had 
a day.

BETTY
Look, Teddy, calm down --

TED
-- Don't call me Teddy.

BETTY
Ted, the night's cake. It's easy. 
The day's when it's busy. During the 
night there's nothing to do.

TED
It's New Year's Eve.

BETTY
Which'll make it less busy than 
normal. Ever worked on Christmas? 
Unless you sell turkeys, business is 
dead. You just got butterflies, that's 
all.

TED
What I have ain't butterflies. I 
can't handle this hotel all by myself.

Betty slows the scene down.

BETTY
Okay, let's calm down a minute. Slow 
it down, cool it off. Let's just 
talk.

TED
You can say any goddamn thing you 
want --

BETTY
-- Ted? I thought we were calming 
down? I thought we were cooling off? 
No hostility. Say good-bye to 
hostility. We're just talking.

TED
Okay... okay... okay... I'm calm, 
I'm cool, let's talk.

BETTY
Ted, in a nutshell, all you have to 
do is hold the fort. It's New Year's 
Eve. Most of the guests are going 
out. You'll just be giving them a 
little nod as they come staggering 
in at three... four... five... in 
the morning. Nobody's having any 
parties, a few get-togethers, but no 
parties. You got about three people 
checking in tonight, that's it. The 
only variable is Chester Rush in the 
penthouse.

TED
Chester Rush? The guy from The Wacky 
Detective?

BETTY
Yeah, him and his entourage checked 
in last night. They're in the 
penthouse. The only reason I refer 
to it as a variable is that he's a 
movie star. Ya never know about movie 
stars. I'm tellin' ya, Ted, it's 
cake.

Betty takes a piece of paper and writes her number down.

BETTY
(continuing)
And look, if you have any problems, 
call me at the party.

Ted thinks about it for a moment.

TED
Okay.

BETTY
Great --

TED
-- For fifty bucks.

BETTY
Fifty bucks!

TED
You're shirking your duties for this 
Nazi. For that you pay a price, and 
the price is fifty bucks.

BETTY
One, Horst is not a Nazi. Two, that's 
not a fair price. You're taking 
advantage of the situation. Twenty 
bucks. Now, twenty bucks is a fair 
price.

TED
Yeah, but what you're doin' to me 
ain't fair. And, you are completely 
and totally taking advantage of me 
and your position. So fifty bucks is 
the perfect price.

Betty begrudgingly digs in her purse.

BETTY
Okay, but don't be a pussy. You don't 
bother me unless it's an emergency. 
In fact, for fifty bucks, you better 
not call me unless the fuckin' 
building's burning down.

She gives him the money.

BETTY
Get ready to take the desk.

Betty leaves.

Ted sits in the chair, takes another drink, and prepares 
himself for the night.

FADE TO BLACK

STORY TITLE CARD:

ROOM 321
"STRANGE BREW"

FADE IN:

EXT. THE MON SIGNOR HOTEL--DUSK

Ted, the bellboy, meets his first guest of the evening, as a 
taxi unloads her luggage. To his warm surprise, the guest is 
a Beautiful Mediterranean Goddess (actually, we will come to 
see she is not technically a goddess, but a High Priestess). 
She is about 25 years old, speaks with an Italian accent and 
is dressed in Gypsy garb. She is Athena.

Ted takes Athena's luggage onto his cart. But one item in a 
woven Moroccan bag proves to be unbearably heavy. Athena is 
concerned as he attempts to lift it.

ATHENA
Pleeze be careful -- my God. You 
have no idea...

Ted strains as he uses all his cojones to lift the insanely 
heavy bag onto the cart. Athena tips the cab driver, stingily. 
The driver winces and gets in the cab. Ted has now managed 
with grunts and groans and strained blood vessels to put 
this thing on the cart. The cab skids away. Athena looks at 
Ted, who is out of breath.

ATHENA
I'm usually a good tipper, but this 
one -- this cab driver -- he had 
green all around him. I don't like 
that in a man.

Ted wheezes and pounds on his chest.

TED
Green? Is that bad? Like you read 
auras or something like that?

ATHENA
Something like that.

TED
Yeah, well what color are you seein' 
around me... how's the tip lookin?

ATHENA
I see purple... in your face, and...

As if she can't help herself, Athena's eyes are strangely 
drawn to his crotch.

She frowns, confused by this impulse. Ted appears to be 
charmingly oblivious.

Athena looks back into his face.

ATHENA
...you're okay.

Ted touches his face -- as if searching for the "purple" in 
it -- and moves the cart inside, discreetly checking out his 
crotch and giving her a confused side glance.

INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK

Ted shifts hats to check the girl in. He checks her 
reservation.

ATHENA
Athena Z.

TED
(scratching his head --
weird name, okay)
You're booked in the Honeymoon Suite --
just one night? With all this luggage?

ATHENA
I will only need to stay till sunrise.

TED
Okay... and how will you be paying?

ATHENA
With gold.

He looks at this wacky Gypsy chick numbly -- she pulls out 
her Gold Card and smiles.

EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK

The doors open and Ted and Athena emerge upon the third floor. 
Ted follows Athena with the cart down the hallway to her 
room.

AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR

Ted opens the door, then lifts the easiest bags first. In 
the center of the room is a Jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids 
poised with urns on each side. A dormant fireplace looms 
beyond the still hot tub.

Ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety -- then looks in 
front of him to Athena as she rubs the round plastic head of 
a little Cupid and mumbles, "Perfect."

Then, arms open wide, chin lifted to heaven, eyes closed, 
she mumbles a faint incantation. Then she does a belly-dance 
wiggle and turns to Ted, who is truly perplexed.

ATHENA
Well -- the other bag -- I need it.

TED
Right.

He starts to lift it, again straining and turning purple. He 
laughs sickly.

TED
What the hell you got in here, lady? 
Nuclear weapons?

She relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the 
bag.

ATHENA
(dryly)
The White Cliffs of Dover.

Ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and 
pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. She hands it 
to him. Ted is grateful and disoriented.

ATHENA
The others will be coming soon. Send 
them, pleeze.

Ted nods, confused by "the others," and walks off with the 
cart. Then he turns from outside the doorway.

TED
Oh -- I forgot to show you how to 
turn on the Jacuzzi.

But Athena is ahead of him -- she flips a switch and water 
begins to flow from the baby cupids' urns into the hot tub.

ATHENA
I been in dis' place many New Year's. 
So... you send the others to me, 
huh. Go now.

As she says this, the door closes with a strange force, 
shutting Ted out. Athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the 
suite.

IN THE SUITE BEDROOM

A round bed with pink tuck'n'roll headboard. It's impossible 
to imagine having an orgasm in this room -- unless it were 
achieved by laughing.

Athena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of 
stone from her tapestry bag. She caresses it and carries it 
like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the 
head of the rock resting on dusty heart-shaped pillows.

Then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching 
high-heeled slippers.

And these she places with reverence on the bed.

ATHENA
On this night, oh great goddess Diana, 
we restore your virgin flesh and 
bring you back to real life.

CLOSE ON the rock slab. We hold the artifact.

ATHENA
Soon -- I take you to the pond for a 
cleansing. Well, it's a swimming 
pool, but it will be under the setting 
sun, okay?

INT. FRONT DESK--DUSK FALLS

Just as Ted is recovering from the mystery of this first 
guest, Elspeth arrives.

She has skin like marble, the body of Venus, piercing blue 
eyes, blond hair and is dressed all in black clothing, like 
Honey West in a rubber dress. She carries several bags, and 
a silver sword on her shoulder.

TED
May I help you?

ELSPETH
I... we... have a reservation.

Then she snaps, irritated, behind her.

ELSPETH
Kiva!

ANGLE ON a young punk rocker chick with long orange hair, a 
long leather coat, wearing a tight T-shirt with studs spelling 
"PUSSY" across her breasts. This is Kiva.

Kiva is kicking the tar and nicotine outta the cigarette 
machine. Just as Ted's eyes grow wide with anxiety, several 
packs of smokes drop into the juvenile delinquent's hands.

KIVA
Wait up, gawd! I had to get supplies 
for this boring ass night.

ELSPETH
(to Ted)
We have a reservation in the Honeymoon 
Suite.

TED
Oh yeah... you must be one of "the 
others." And what're you carrying -- 
the Rock of Gibraltar?

She stares at him without humor. He fumbles for the key. He 
walks around the desk to help her with her black crocodile 
luggage. Jars clang inside. He is ready to go, but Elspeth 
turns to lecture Kiva on the hazards of smoking, as Kiva 
lights up.

ELSPETH
What'd I tell you about smoking?

KIVA
You smoke.

ELSPETH
That's right -- I smoke, and I'm 
addicted to it, and I don't want the 
same thing to happen to you.

KIVA
(in game-show host 
voice)
"Hello -- welcome to this week's 
edition of the Hypocrite of the Year 
Award --"

As Kiva goes off on her impression of a game-show host, 
Elspeth is growing increasingly rageful, like a mother with 
an unruly child. Ted waits, luggage in hand.

ELSPETH
Kiva! That's enough --

She cuts Kiva's ramble off. Kiva blows smoke defiantly.

KIVA
You're not my mother!

ELSPETH
Yes I am.

KIVA
Then why're we sleeping together?

Ted looks on uneasily at the relationship that is beginning 
to unfold here.

Elspeth checks his reaction and becomes self-conscious at 
his scrutiny.

ELSPETH
Well... I didn't mean it... literally. 
I... I happen to be the only one 
who... cares about you --

But her wild child looks off, bored. Elspeth turns to Ted, 
flustered.

ELSPETH
Please -- take us to our room!

Ted smiles uneasily and reaches to relieve her of her sword, 
but Elspeth quickly slams her palm on the sword and shoots 
him a piercing glare. He jumps back with a light nervous 
laugh. He leads the way to the elevator.

AT THE HONEYMOON SUITE DOOR

The couch has been set out here in the hall, as well as coffee 
tables, lamps, and the TV. Elspeth and Kiva enter the room. 
Athena is gone. As Ted stumbles around the furniture in the 
hall, he peers in the room and see a transformation. With 
most of the furniture removed, candles and incense and flowers 
are beginning to form an altar around the fireplace.

But oddest of all is the pink-tinged water swirling in the 
Jacuzzi and pouring from the cupid urns. A sprinkle of white 
powder on the carpet encircles the hot tub. Elspeth hands 
him a tip as he gawks at the circle.

ELSPETH
Flea powder. One of the others is 
bringing her cat.

Ted starts away again, perplexed. He turns for one last look 
to see Elspeth kneeling before Kiva, who sprawls on the floor. 
He shakes his head and leaves.

ELSPETH
You're gonna have to wait in the 
other room.

KIVA
Why?

ELSPETH
Because I said so.

KIVA
I'll watch TV.

ELSPETH
You can't watch TV because the noise 
will interfere with our ritual.

Kiva looks around the room and spies the TV in the hallway. 
She turns to Elspeth with sarcastic concession.

KIVA
Okay... Mommy.

Elspeth bristles as the brat saunters off to the bedroom. 
Elspeth enters the sacred circle, stands before the altar, 
whips out her sword, and makes a ceremonial gesture pointing 
the sword upward, perfectly centered between her breasts.

Kiva, behind Elspeth's back, exits from the bedroom doorway 
into the hall and comes back in, lugging the TV into the 
honeymoon bedroom.

Elspeth kneels before the altar. Athena enters the room with 
the "cleansed" artifact and lays the slab in the center of 
the altar upon the heart-shaped pillows as Elspeth lays her 
sword next to the rock. The women look upon the union with 
tender affection.

ATHENA
Soon -- our goddess will come. I 
will go get her negligee.

Athena stands up but her reverie is dispelled as she shrieks! 
Loud TV suddenly blasts from the bedroom and Kiva the brat 
is trying on the pink negligee over her clothes. Athena takes 
the negligee off the irrepressible youth.

ATHENA
What are you doing! Have you no 
respect -- who -- who is dis girl?

ELSPETH
Kiva. My friend. Kiva, turn off the 
TV! I can't leave her at home -- 
she's on probation and I gotta keep 
an eye on her.

ATHENA
Well, Elspeth, your friend cannot 
stay here during the ritual. She may 
be one of your kind, but she is not 
one of us.

ELSPETH
She stays!! Or I go -- along with my 
offering!

The women have a stare-down. Then Athena calls out --

ATHENA
TURN OF THE FUCKING TV, MAN!

KIVA
(in a seductive pout)
Make me...

Elspeth becomes anxious with jealousy. Athena is exasperated 
as she firmly demands from Elspeth --

ATHENA
Let's not forget -- I am the High 
Fucking Priestess. Deal with dis 
girl!

Elspeth defers to Athena with remembered reverence and 
respect. She bows apologetic and scurries to the bedroom.

ATHENA
(eyes lifted to heaven, 
wearily)
Tell me -- did we have these problems 
in Salem? I don't think so...

IN THE BEDROOM

Elspeth swallows her rage and approaches the brat with a 
soft touch.

ELSPETH
Kiva... you know what I love about 
you?

Kiva smirks... yeah, she knows.

ELSPETH
Your sweet side.

KIVA
And what do I get if I'm sweet?

ELSPETH
You get whatever you want. And you 
know what else I love about you?

KIVA
(seduced now)
What?

ELSPETH
Your nose.

And saying this, she kisses Kiva's nose and leaves the room. 
Kiva is quieted now. As Elspeth closes the bedroom door, she 
has the last word.

ELSPETH
And I saw you checking her out.

Kiva slinks back on the bed, put in her place -- for now.

IN THE HALLWAY/EXT. ELEVATOR--DUSK

The doors open and Ted pushes a cart of expensive designer 
luggage -- and lots of it -- behind yet another Gorgeous 
Gal. This one is Jezebel, a Southern beauty, fawning over 
her cat, as she carries nothing else, and proceeds down the 
hall like a Southern princess.

JEZEBEL
(talking to her cat 
in baby talk)
Oh you little stinker... oh you sweet 
little muffin. Yes... Mama loves the 
baby.

AT THE DOOR

Jezebel bursts in, chattering.

JEZEBEL
Well, this is just darlin'! Just 
darlin' Hi-dee, girls...

Ted carries all her bags inside awkwardly. Again, the place 
has become all the more transformed with wild canopies of 
exotic cloths and fixings. Elspeth and Athena are hard at 
work on a strange nature sculpture as Jezebel enters. She 
stands inside the powdered circle and before the hot tub, 
which now has dark blue water swirling inside. She presents 
her cat -- upward toward heaven -- frees the cat, bares her 
breasts and sucks in the vibes: "Ahhhh."

Ted settles the bags down, hoping for a peek at her charms, 
but her back is to him. The kitty rubs on her leg. She picks 
it up and presses it against her bare breasts, petting it 
sweetly. She winks and hands him a tip.

JEZEBEL
Toodle-loo.

And saying this, she shoos him away. Through the glass doors 
to the bedroom, she sees Kiva sprawled on the bed, writing 
on herself.

JEZEBEL
Well -- I see Elspeth has herself a 
new lil' fool -- what the hell is 
she doin' here on our night of annual 
ritual?

ATHENA
(wearily)
I have sanctioned her presence, as 
long as she behaves. Come on -- there 
is more work to be done to welcome 
our great Diana.

KIVA
I WANT ROOM SERVICE!!

ELSPETH
Why do I always attract girls who 
are looking for a babysitter?

JEZEBEL
Well now, honey, maybe Juvenile Hall 
ain't the best place to find serious 
relationship material.

Elspeth seethes at her. Jezebel acts blithely innocent.

IN THE HALLWAY

Ted is walking from the room with the cart. His face is etched 
in a mask of perpetual frown as he looks at the tip in his 
hand -- at least these lunachicks tip well.

Waking him out of his deep mood is Raven. Another female 
intoxication, she wears a short skirt, all done up in Native 
American, Southwestern themes. No shoes.

But she carries a small, old handmade broom. She moves down 
the hall, blissed-out. Ted makes eye contact, despite himself.

RAVEN
I'm looking for the room for making 
love.

TED
You might be referring to the 
Honeymoon Suite. Straight thata way... 
you can't miss it -- see all that 
furniture in the hallway --

RAVEN
Oh I know the way. I just wanted you 
to know that I knew where I was going 
and that you needn't bother yourself 
with me. The others are here -- great!

TED
(wearily)
Oh yeah -- it's so great -- it's 
fantastic.

RAVEN
(in deep empathy)
Ohhh... I know it all seems very 
strange but you're coping with us 
much better than the bellboys of 
past New Year's.

TED
Past New Year's?

RAVEN
Oh yes -- we've been coming here 
every New Year... for a long time. 
Thanks for your patience.

TED
Oh hey -- no problem -- wreck the 
place. Bring in cats. Ruin the carpet 
with flea powder, pour paint in the 
Jacuzzi. Throw the furniture out 
the... where're your bags?

RAVEN
I travel very light.

Ted looks down at the broom at her side, her bare feets, her 
thick dark hair. It keeps getting weirder. She wanders off.

INT. FRONT DESK--NIGHT

The last of the lovely girls arrives. She is different from 
the others. She looks like a farm girl, very Earth Mother, 
with a tablecloth halter top and skirt, sandals, and a simple 
scarf over her long dark curls. She carries two bags by 
herself and holds a small black pot under her arm. She is 
Eva.

TED
(already weary of 
these girls)
Yeah, yeah, Honeymoon Suite.

EVA
Oh... yes... I'm late.

She lowers her eyes, worried.

TED
All right -- lemme give ya a hand.

EVA
Oh... no, that's all right. I can 
carry them by myself.

She is so sweet and sincere that he feels like a heel to 
have been irritated with her. He picks up her bags.

TED
I'm a man doin' a job -- no hero.

Eva smiles, beautifully.

EVA
Well gosh -- thank you!

IN THE ELEVATOR

Ted holds Eva's hippy sacks as she holds her black pot. There 
is a shy quiet tension here.

EVA
Tell me, how long have the others 
been here?

TED
About an hour.

Eva's heart sinks. They arrive at the door. He carries her 
bags in.

IN THE SUITE

The room is entirely transformed into a beautiful glowing 
palace with an elaborate altar, both earthly and the other-
earthly. The other four girls are arranging the altar as Eva 
enters.

ATHENA
You are very late, Eva.

EVA
I'm sorry, Athena. I was attending a 
birth and the placenta was late in 
coming.

Ted is slightly queasy. She hands him a tip and smiles, then 
takes it back.

EVA
Oh, wait, lemme give you a little 
more than that...

Ted's no fool, he waits while Eva looks through her change 
purse.

ELSPETH
Which birth is more important to 
you, that of a mortal or that of a 
goddess?

EVA
All life is precious... but I do 
apologize for being late, Elspeth.

JEZEBEL
Back home, they jist yank on the 
umbilical cord, do a Karate chop on 
the mama's belly, and them things 
come right out.

EVA
They do that here, too, Jezebel, in 
the hospitals, but it causes 
hemorrhages. I fed the mother a bowl 
of comfrey tea and it brought the 
afterbirth down perfectly. The couple 
are going to use it for fertilizer 
to plant a lovely tree for their 
baby.

KIVA
Oh wow -- if they were really back-
to-nature, they'd eat it, like other 
mammals do.

CLOSE ON Ted's face as he gets thoroughly grossed out.

RAVEN
In some Native American cultures, 
they dry the umbilical cord, grind 
it to a fine powder, and put it in a 
leather pouch that the baby wears to 
ward off evil. But burying the 
placenta is also a very sound 
ecological practice -- 'cause of the 
oxygen it carries.

EVA
(cheerfully to the 
others)
Yes -- because you see when the 
placenta detaches from the uterine 
wall...

TED
(wincing in disgust)
Uh, thank you, ladies -- I'll be 
going now. If you need anything --

Eva places a nice tip in his palm.

ATHENA
Wait. We do need a few things.

Ted sighs as Eva enters the circle with her black pot. She 
kneels softly, holds her hands in piety before the altar, 
and softly incants as she offers her pot and places it on 
the altar. The stone and sword and flowers now rest here on 
pillows covered in chiffon scarves. The negligee hangs from 
the mantel, the slippers underneath as if expecting someone 
to materialize into the garments.

ATHENA
We need fresh rosemary from the 
kitchen. Mostly what we need is from 
the kitchen. Hey, are you listening?

Ted is watching Eva, enchanted.

TED
Yeah, yeah, rosemary.

ATHENA
And a little bit of sea salt or Kosher 
salt if you don't got no sea salt. A 
bottle of spring water -- Italian 
please, not French shit.

KIVA
And some french fries!

ELSPETH
Kiva, shut up.

ATHENA
(irritated)
And some ginger, two of the eyes of 
a trout fish, and a piece of raw 
meat, liver if you have it.

KIVA
(whining)
I want fries -- you dumb jerks with 
your stupid fucking ritual!

ATHENA
Shut up, you little shit.

ELSPETH
Don't talk to her that way!

Ted has scribbled down the items as she speaks. He looks at 
this list and these girls and shudders as he walks away. He 
turns, points at Eva.

Ted smiles at this angel of a girl. She smiles back. But, as 
she looks him in the eyes, he feels a strange buzzing 
connection happening. He holds his head, almost swooning 
with dizziness. Athena smirks.

ATHENA
Get to work, man.

Ted comes out of his daze, looks at the list again and huffs 
off. After he goes, the girls begin to bring forth their 
most treasured offerings in ornate ancient bottles, vases or 
vials.

Jezebel folds her arms and clears her throat in the direction 
of Kiva, sitting idly on the edge of the blue water Jacuzzi, 
with her feet dipping irreverently in the water.

ELSPETH
Kiva...

KIVA
What?

ELSPETH
You have to go in the next room now.

KIVA
Oh, wow, like I'm bummed out that I 
can't watch.
(whining at Elspeth)
I'm bored!

ELSPETH
UP!

She climbs up the stairs, trying to pull the brat to her 
feet.

KIVA
Don't put me in there by myself. 
I'll miss you way too much.

ELSPETH
Kiva, don't do this to me.

Kiva sees a bit of weakening here; she takes her feet out of 
the Jacuzzi. She begins to speak softly.

KIVA
Please... if you just lemme... I'll 
play dress-up with you, the way you 
like it... you know what I mean... 
remember...?

Elspeth begins to weaken. But continues to pull the brat up. 
Kiva pours on softer seduction.

KIVA
We can pretend and I'll do it 
exactly... the way you want it... 
with the egg whites and the kilt.

Elspeth is now fully seduced. Kiva takes Elspeth's hand and 
presses it lightly on her face.

ELSPETH
You mean... like last week?

Kiva nods. Elspeth is enthralled, but from a disgusted "ick" 
sound from Jezebel, Elspeth realizes she's revealing this 
side of her life -- in front of her coven. She nervously 
looks around and see all the coven looking at her: a disgusted 
Jezebel, an understanding Raven, a preoccupied Eva and an 
impatient and stern Athena.

Elspeth comes to her senses, straightens her posture.

ELSPETH
We'll talk about this later, Kiva.

KIVA
(angrily)
No!

She turns on Elspeth and bites her hand. Elspeth pulls her 
arm away and grabs Kiva by the hair.

JEZEBEL
Aw, really now -- child abuse?

ELSPETH
You stay outta this!

ATHENA
I demand this stop now, Elspeth!

Elspeth lets go of Kiva's hair. Kiva jerks away from her.

KIVA
I'm running away from you!

ELSPETH
Fine. Go ahead. And I'll call your 
parole officer and she'll find you 
and send you back to Eastlake!

Kiva stomps off into the bedroom.

ATHENA
Now that the fucking melodrama is 
over, can we start the goddamn ritual --
pleeze?

Elspeth enters the powered circle. Each girl takes off her 
shoes. They anoint themselves with oils.

ATHENA
We are communing here on New Year's 
Eve to bring to life the great goddess 
Diana, who was turned to stone in 
this very room forty years ago today.

The girls moan in sleepy, eerie agreement as they begin to 
sway within the circle.

ATHENA
Diana, great beautiful one, we make 
these offerings to you, that we may 
undo the wicked spell which deprived 
you of the seed of your lover, your 
virginal blood, of your very life. 
We now form the symbolic rock with 
our bodies.

And saying this, the girls all form a "rock" with their bodies 
gracefully draped one upon the other. Music begins, and slowly 
they start to unfold from the rock.

The girls each find their place in a semicircle around the 
Jacuzzi. Some bare their breasts, other strip off a layer of 
clothes. They anoint their arms with water from the Jacuzzi.

They begin a lovely dance, snaking their way around the 
semicircle. The first one to go from one end to the other is 
Athena. She then proceeds up the stairs and positions herself 
between the altar and the Jacuzzi. She steps forth with a 
bottle to the altar and pours it into the Jacuzzi.

ATHENA
On this night, in this hour, we Call 
upon the Ancient Power O Goddess 
bride, I offer thee Milk from a 
mother's sweet titty!

Each of the girls moans eerily. Athena places the bottle on 
the altar and bows away. She joins the circle as Elspeth now 
steps forward with her offering in a vial.

ELSPETH
To reverse the evil which has been 
done I make this offering to the 
Divine One A whore not, an innocent 
was, For whom I seized a virgin's 
blood.

JEZEBEL
Goddess of Light, Goddess of Lust, 
To undo this awful spell is a real 
must. To bring you life and get you 
high I offer the sweat of five men's 
thighs.

The girls moan loudly as they sway. Jezebel places her 
offering in the hot tub and bows out, returning to the circle. 
Now Raven comes forth with a small leather canteen. She 
unscrews the lid as she offers in her opiate stupor.

RAVEN
Diana, oh great one, we live without 
sun Until this wicked curse is undone. 
In hope that you live, and to us 
appear, I have collected a year's 
worth of tears.

She pours liquid into the mix, as the witches moan. Now it's 
Eva's turn. Eva continues to sway, not moving forth to the 
altar. The girls keep their eyes closed as they sway, waiting 
for Eva's offering. Athena finally gives her a push and she 
goes.

Eva kneels before the altar. She produces a silver bottle 
with a chain on its cap and neck. She timidly begins to 
incant.

EVA
Great Goddess Diana, fail you I will, 
I was to bring fresh sperm from my 
Bill. I had him erect, and his semen 
would follow But alas I was hot, so 
hot that I swallowed.

The moans turn to wails as the girls GASP and SHRIEK! Athena 
opens her eyes, wildly.

ATHENA
You stupid little witch! You swallowed 
the sperm! Aye-yi--yi!

Elspeth opens her eyes and folds her arms, smirking bitterly.

ELSPETH
It just shows what an amazing lack 
of control you have over yourself, 
Eva!

JEZEBEL
Honey, why didn't you just use your 
hands? Didn't your mama teach you 
not to put them things in your mouth?

RAVEN
I understand though...

Eva bursts into tears. Athena is firm.

ATHENA
There is no time to cry over swallowed 
sperms. You're gonna have to get 
some, baby. You have one hour to 
prove what kind of witch you really 
are.

Just then: a knock at the door.

ATHENA
(calling out)
What do you want?!

TED
Ted... the bellboy.

Athena smiles and turns to Eva.

ATHENA
Mr. Bellboy, come right in!

Ted opens the door. His eyes bulge out as he looks upon the 
fleshly feast. He steps back. They giggle seductively, all 
except Eva, who sniffles, red-eyed.

Amazingly, Ted's attention is captivated by Eva's sorrow, 
not by the naked charms of the other witches. She shyly covers 
her breasts. Sensitive to her shame and sorrow, he looks 
away and steps from the door to fetch the room-service cart. 
Athena directs the others to put on their shirts. Ted wheels 
in the cart.

TED
Here's the things you asked for. Oh, 
and uhh, sorry, but I'm not gonna 
pick the eyes outta this dead fish.

He points to the trout. Elspeth picks it up, flings the eyes 
into the Jacuzzi, and tosses the trout out of the window. 
She smirks at him comtemptuously.

ATHENA
(handing Ted 50 bucks)
Okay, mister, here's your fifty-dollar 
tip, only, you have to do one more 
thing... make our little Eva smile. 
Can you? We'll leave you alone.
(to Eva, firmly)
And don't use your mouth!

The girls step out. Athena turns to Eva and points to her 
watch, then holds up one finger. Eva looks up, worried. The 
door closes on her and Ted. She looks at Ted and sighs. He 
covers her with a shawl.

IN THE HALLWAY

The other witches listen at the door.

ELSPETH
If she doesn't get his goop in ten 
minutes, I'm going to take him myself.

JEZEBEL
Ha! That'll be a first for you.

ELSPETH
Oh shit -- Kiva!

She runs back in for her bratty girlfriend, who is already 
sneaking out the bedroom door.

ELSPETH
And just where do you think you're 
going?

KIVA
Well, gawd -- I need a candy bar or 
something -- you haven't fed me all 
day. I'm getting all shaky. My blood 
sugar's really low.

JEZEBEL
Elspeth -- honestly now -- some 
babysitter you're turnin' out ta be!

ATHENA
Enough, girls. I will collect fresh 
earth. Jezebel, I want you to gather 
damp moss. Raven, you bring me a 
birch branch.

Elspeth, you go feed your terrible girlfriend. We meet back 
here in one hour and let's all have faith that Eva can get 
this guy off.

The witches disperse.

INT. HONEYMOON SUITE--NIGHT

Eva sits among pillows before the altar as Ted stands in 
front of her. Ted is trying his best to make poor Eva smile. 
But no matter what his antics, she looks off sadly.

TED
Help me out, lady. I gotta earn this 
fifty bucks!

EVA
Oh look, they don't care if I smile 
or not! All they want is...

Ted waits; she sighs and rest her chin in her hand.

EVA
You won't understand, believe me.

She begins to cry tearfully again.

TED
Try me. I've been around, y'know.

He postures proudly, all puffed out. Eva looks at him 
helplessly. And he paternally encourages her to explain.

EVA
Well... okay. The five of us -- 
Elspeth, Jezebel, Athena, Raven and 
me -- are a coven.

TED
Ha, like a coven of witches?

EVA
Yes.

TED
(stunned)
Oh.

He looks around the room: QUICK CUTS of candles, iconography, 
jars of lurid substances, unknown body parts of animals woven 
into the nature sculpture... and are those tongues in that 
can? Ted's getting the creeps, but again puffs himself up.

TED
I knew that!

EVA
(getting calmer)
And you see, our coven has spent 
forty years trying to perfect a ritual 
to undo a wicked curse put on our 
goddess Diana.

TED
Gee, you don't look a day over twenty!

EVA
Oh... ha ha... I mean the witches 
before us tried and failed. But 
Athena, our High Priestess, discovered 
a great potion to reverse the evil 
spell which turned our beautiful 
goddess into an old rock.

TED
(looking at the rock)
Yeah? Is... is that her?

Eva nods, looking lovingly at the stone.

EVA
She was a beautiful virgin. An 
entertainer by trade, but a great 
sorceress by design. It was here in 
this very room, on her wedding night, 
a jealous rival placed the curse on 
Diana.

TED
She turned to -- that -- here?

EVA
Yes... and her young husband turned 
into a pink fish! They found him 
swimming in the pool in circles. 
While our dear goddess: a stone in 
her honeymoon bed.

Ted frowns as he ponders all this. Eva takes a photo from 
the altar and hands it to Ted.

EVA
This was Diana.

CLOSE ON photo: a Blond Bombshell in full-on Betty Page 
attire, a bare-tittied pinup girl, playfully spanking a girl 
in bondage with a spiked high heel.

TED
This girl here? This is the goddess 
Diana?

The photograph slowly comes alive. Diana stops spanking the 
girl and unties her.

She pulls the girl (in the black satin mask) up off her lap 
and makes the girl stand. The women face each other and break 
into a cheek-to-cheek tango.

CLOSE ON Ted as he shakes his head. Are his eyes playing 
tricks on him?

TED
I hate to tell you this, but I kinda 
doubt she was a virgin.

EVA
Oh, but she was! She had lovers, but 
she saved that for marriage. Which 
is the example I've tried to follow: 
to do everything but that till I 
marry...

She begins to sob again. Ted comforts her.

TED
Hey, don't cry... a virgin is a rare 
and beautiful thing. If you say she 
was a virgin, I'll believe it.

EVA
Well, it doesn't matter now... and 
she won't be resurrected tonight 
'cause I failed her. I let my whole 
coven down!

TED
Wait a sec -- that rock was gonna 
turn back into this?

He holds up the photo. Eva nods.

TED
Now, that would be something worth 
seeing!

EVA
Only, not now -- we were each supposed 
to bring something -- a life fluid.

TED
(wincing in disgust)
If this is gonna be like one of those 
afterbirth conversations, I don't 
think I wanna hear this.

EVA
Only... I swallowed it...

TED
You swallowed what?

Eva looks off. Ted searches his brains, thoroughly sickened 
now.

TED
You mean, you were supposed to 
bring... like... like a guy's... and 
you...?

She nods; he winces, queasy. Eva looks at him, helpless.

EVA
And now, you're my last chance!

TED
(laughing)
Yeah, sure.
(then -- panic)
Whoa, what? You want my -- for the -- 
witchy poo -- ahh no -- no way -- 
nope. Besides, it's against hotel 
policy. I was warned: "No sex with 
the clientele"!

Eva sobs, pleading. She throws off her shawl, baring her 
lovely breasts, and reaches her arms around his neck. He 
keeps backing off. Unbeknownst to him, he is already doing a 
ritualistic shuffle.

TED
Ha, c'mon now, joke's over.
(seeing this is no 
joke)
Hey, we're gonna step in the flea 
powder.

EVA
That's not flea powder, that's sacred 
dust ground from the horns of Albino 
goats.

TED
Right! I knew that!

He is backing away, into the circle, as she comes for him, 
soft and sweet. Her eyes are again putting the magic hex on 
him, as he tries to resist her gaze.

TED
What's a nice girl like you doing in 
a coven, anyway?

EVA
Well, see, what I really want to do 
is be a midwife. I've attended four 
births already! I can prevent vaginal 
tears and everything.

TED
(trying to dodge her 
hexing eyes)
Well, that's a good thing! A guy 
doesn't like surprises down there.

All the while she is stepping toward him into the circle.

EVA
I joined the coven to attain greater 
understanding of my feminine power 
so I could become a truly great 
midwife!

TED
(the hex working now)
Oh, well, I see you've been gaining 
a lot of insight into your... girl 
powers...

Eva sweetly takes his hand and places it on her breast.

EVA
Do you really think so?

TED
(buckling under the 
temptation)
Well, yeah, I'd say that seems to be 
the case...
(she licks his neck; 
his eyes roll back 
heavenly)
Ohhh, God! Betty's gonna kill me!

EVA
Who's Betty -- your girlfriend?

TED
No. My boss.

EVA
Oh good!

TED
Oh no!

They fall into a kiss, as she begins to remove his cap. She 
moves him toward the Jacuzzi, closer and closer.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HALLWAY--NIGHT

Ted pushes his room-service cart. He is flushed. Puffed up. 
Lights a cigarette, takes a great big, satisfied drag. Eva 
runs to the door dreamily, her naked body wrapped in her 
shawl. She passes him a card.

EVA
My phone number in Topanga. Call me?

TED
(cocky)
Sure, baby. Yeah, I'll give ya a 
call.

She smiles and shuts the door. The other witches are arriving 
with supplies from the garden. Kiva, now having raised her 
blood sugar, sucks on a lollipop, a sunny girl. She talks to 
Raven, who carries a birch limb.

KIVA
What's that used for?

RAVEN
It's a birch branch, symbolizing 
eternal life. You can also use the 
bark for a tea which assists in astral 
travel.

KIVA
Hey -- I wanna be a witch!

The other girls roll their eyes as Elspeth smiles proudly. 
Ted blows smoke at them and pushes his cart off down the 
hall. The witches run inside the room.

IN THE SUITE

Eva sits, blissed-out, in the center of the circle, smiles.

EVA
I'm a woman now!

ATHENA
But where is his "stuff"?

EVA
(pointing to the 
Jacuzzi)
We did it right there, in the big 
cauldron!

JEZEBEL
Ooohhh honey, you're gonna be sore 
tomorra! Didn't your mama teach you 
that water strips a girl's 
lubrication?

RAVEN
Sex in water is great in the movies, 
not in real life... but you will 
learn. As we all did.

JEZEBEL
Yeah, when she can't walk...
(to Elspeth)
I guess you wouldn't have those kinds 
of problems -- without penetration.

ELSPETH
No. And virtually no cervical cancer, 
either.

ATHENA
Okay, girls, enough Sex Education 
101, let's get going with our ritual, 
goddammit.

Athena regally leads the ritual as they all bare their breasts 
again. Kiva throws off her shirt to join in. As she does, we 
see black bondage tape on her nipples. Elspeth darts a quick 
look at the tape, looks at the other witches -- not sure she 
likes this -- but she goes with it. The witches sway in a 
circle, eyes closed, as Eva makes her offering.

EVA
Goddess Diana, I offer you The jism 
of one I wooed for you That you may 
live and know such bliss Of getting 
laid by a guy like this.

The witches all incant.

ALL OF THE WITCHES
So must it be. Three times three 
times three.

They march half-naked as they moan and revel in eerie cries. 
The Jacuzzi begins to bubble and boil. Their cries heighten; 
the potion bubbles over.

DISSOLVE TO:

HOURS LATER

Athena reads from a huge leatherbound book, The Book of 
Shadows, full of potions and spells. Four discouraged witches 
pack their bags. The room has been restored to its worldly 
under-splendor. Kiva uses the remote on the TV... so much 
for witchcraft. The slab of rock remains a slab.

ATHENA
I don't understand what went wrong.

ELSPETH
I say Eva pulled one over on us.

EVA
What?

JEZEBEL
Honey -- Eva was wearing the face of 
someone just fucked good... and the 
best actress in this world, or any 
other, can't fake a thing like that!

ELSPETH
Exactly -- if she was fucked so good, 
how could she save his come?

RAVEN
It could be done...

ATHENA
Girls, knock it off.
(she looks up from 
the book)
Maybe... maybe it needed to be the 
sperm of a virgin male.

EVA
(dreamily)
He was no virgin!

The witches sadly collect their things. Athena, deep in 
thought, strokes the slab.

ATHENA
Let's leave her here, with the sword, 
until dawn. I will come back for her 
before checkout time. I just... feel 
too sad to carry her away before the 
sun comes up to warm her.

They all agree. They pick up their bags and head out.

JEZEBEL
(cuddling her cat)
I can't believe we have to carry our 
own bags out! My mama would have a 
hissy fit!

KIVA
(flirtatiously)
I'll carry your bags.

ELSPETH
(firmly)
You're carrying my bags!

They leave the room. Jezebel's cat leaps from her arms as 
she hoists her luggage. Eva walks out satisfied, thought 
perhaps a little sore -- "ouch," she says, and smiles. Athena 
takes one last look at their goddess slab.

ATHENA
Next year, we try again -- with virgin 
sperm.

She closes the door on the Honeymoon Suite (till next New 
Year's Eve!).

FADE TO BLACK.

FOUR ROOMS

FADE UP ON:

INT. MON SIGNOR LOBBY--NIGHT

Ted behind the desk, on the phone. We only hear his side.

TED
Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? Do 
you want milk and cookies, or do you 
not?
(pause)
I can't turn on an adult station 
without permission from your parents.
(pause, he checks his 
computer)
That's not what the machine tells 
me.
(pause)
You be good and you'll get milk and 
cookies, but for now leave me alone, 
please. I'll be up later to put you 
both to sleep.

He hangs up.

TED
(to himself)
Goddamn kids.

SUPER: 1:00 a.m.

The phone rings again.

TED
Room Service.

INT. ROOM 404--NIGHT

A small party is going on. A long-haired Yuppie Scum type in 
on the line. Music BLARES. People dance in background.

YUPPIE SCUM
What room am I in?

INT. FRONT DESK--NIGHT

BACK AND FORTH

TED
This is the front desk, sir.

The Yuppie turns away from the phone and speaks to Real 
Theodore.

YUPPIE SCUM
What room are we in?

REAL THEODORE
How should I know? I just got here.

YUPPIE SCUM
(into phone)
You know, don't you have one of those 
light things?

TED
If you care to go to the door and 
look on the other side, you'll find 
the room number.

YUPPIE SCUM
(to Real Theodore)
Call my assistant and ask her what 
floor we're on.

REAL THEODORE
Who's your assistant?

YUPPIE SCUM
The girl you party with every night.

REAL THEODORE
(to himself)
Who?

TED
I'm here alone, sir.

REAL THEODORE
It's room 404, I think.

YUPPIE SCUM
I could have sworn we were on the 
fifth floor.

REAL THEODORE
Right. 404.

YUPPIE SCUM
(into phone)
Right. 404.

TED
What do you need, sir?

YUPPIE SCUM
(to Real Theodore)
What do we need?

REAL THEODORE
Ice.

YUPPIE SCUM
Ice?

REAL THEODORE
Ice.

YUPPIE SCUM
(into phone)
Ice.

TED
Ice.

YUPPIE SCUM
Yeah. Ice.

TED
Right, sir. Ice. 404. I'll be with 
you momentarily.

CUT TO:

STORY TITLE CARD:

ROOM 404
"THE WRONG MAN"

INT. DARK HALLWAY

Ted saunters down a hallway with a butt hanging out the corner 
of his mouth and a bucket of ice swinging at his side. He 
pulls up at a door on which the faded numbers read something 
like "Room 404."

Ted knocks on the door. After a moment, the latch is thrown 
and the door swings open. Ted cautiously steps into the dark 
room.

INT. ROOM

TED
Anybody home?

A DEMONIC CACKLE cuts through the darkness.

MAN'S VOICE
No one here but us chickens.

TED
Say, it's pretty dark in here, sir.

MAN'S VOICE
What do you expect, Theodore, a 
fuckin' floor show?

TED
Do I know you?

MAN'S VOICE
I don't know. Do you?

In a flash the lights switch on and Ted finds himself staring 
down the barrel of a pretty intense-looking .357 Magnum, 
cocked and ready to fire. At the other end of the gun stands 
a 50-year-old man, Sigfried, who sports a Cheshire Cat smile 
and a "just try fuckin' with me" look on his face. Sigfried 
isn't the only person in the room. Directly behind him sits 
a beautiful young woman, Angela, gagged and bound to a chair. 
Ted drops the bucket to the floor.

TED
I brought your ice.

SIGFRIED
That's cute. In fact, the whole 
getup's kind of cute. The monkey 
suit's a nice touch, honey puss.

TED
This has to be a mistake. Is this 
room 404?

SIGFRIED
Theodore? What do you take me for, 
Theodore?

TED
A very upset man?

Sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of 
assorted stimulants into his mouth, chewing on them like 
they were breath mints. Sigfried thrusts his hand forward, 
gripping Ted by the throat, and leads him to Angela.

SIGFRIED
(to Angela)
I am an upset man, Theodore.

TED
How do you know my name, sir?

SIGFRIED
I'm psychic, Theodore.

TED
Look my name is Ted, actually, and I 
have no idea what's going on here, 
but I've obviously come at a bad 
time.

SIGFRIED
Let's not belabor the fact that you 
have no sense of timing, Theodore. 
The fact is you're here.

Sigfried turns to Angela.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
And I couldn't think of a better 
time for you to introduce me to your 
beau than on New Year's Eve.

TED
Oh fuck, there's a mistake. You're 
fucking wrong here. My name is 
Theodore, yes! My mother named me 
that and I hate the name. But I'm a 
fucking bellhop. People call me Ted. 
I work here.

Suddenly, with great force, Sigfried slams the butt of his 
pistol smack into Ted's temple, sending him to the floor. 
Ted looks up at Sigfried in shock.

SIGFRIED
Look, I'd love to sit here all night 
with you talking about things like 
when you broke in your first mitt --
(pause)
That was insensitive of me, wasn't 
it, T H E O D O R E? But let's cut 
to the chase, okay?

TED
Okay.

SIGFRIED
So apologize!

A tense silence fills the room. All eyes are on Ted, who 
can't figure out what the fuck this guy wants.

TED
For what?

Sigfried looks hard with disbelief at Ted, who winces back.

SIGFRIED
You are really beginning to annoy 
me, Theodore.

Sigfried throws another handful of pills into his mouth.

TED
Look, obviously you two are working 
something out and if I could help 
you with your problem I would.

SIGFRIED
What are you saying? Are you saying 
I got a problem? Are you trying to 
say I don't give her what she needs? 
That I'm FUCKING INSENSITIVE!!

TED
Look, is this about another man? Or 
something?

Ted has struck a raw nerve. Sigfried's mood swings 
drastically; he bends down next to Ted.

SIGFRIED
Let's get our ABC's right, here, 
Theodore. Theodore, right?

TED
Ted's better.

SIGFRIED
Ted, okay... Are you saying my wife 
cheats on me?

TED
I didn't say that... I...

SIGFRIED
Oh, for Christ's sake, Theodore, 
this is about as intimate a situation 
as you can get, you, me, and Angela 
here. It's pretty cozy. To say nothing 
of how stupid an idea it is to lie 
to a man with a loaded gun without 
considering the possible response. I 
demand an apology!

The phone rings.

SIGFRIED
Don't move. I've got to take this.

Sigfried glances at it. Then to Angela. He picks up the phone.

SIGFRIED
(into phone)
What?
(pause)
We ain't got any needles here, kid. 
Just a big fucking gun.

He listens to the other line, says good-bye, and hangs up.

SIGFRIED
(to Ted)
Now, where was I? Oh yeah, I remember.

Sigfried kneels next to Ted and assumes a prayer position.

SIGFRIED
I want you to pray for forgiveness, 
Theodore.

Sigfried, hands clasped together, signals for Ted to do the 
same. The gun lies at his side. Ted considers a bold move, 
but thinks better of it. Sigfried's eyes pop open. He cuts a 
look to Ted, signaling him to assume the pose.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
Now say after me, "I apologize..."

TED
I apologize...

SIGFRIED
For what?

Ted looks to Angela for help. She can only stare back with 
intense, wide-open eyes.

SIGFRIED
For fucking what?

TED
That I said you might have been 
unfaithful?

SIGFRIED
"That I said you might have been 
unfaithful?" Listen, Theodore, you're 
in church here... you're kneeling in 
front of an altar. Truth... truth is 
all it hears. Say the following, "I, 
Theodore, must humbly and sincerely 
apologize for saying that you fucked 
another man!"

Ted repeats what Sigfried has told him. This appears to have 
a calming effect on Sigfried, who gets up off the floor, 
turning his face to Angela.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
Satisfied?

Angela nods.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
Do you accept the fucking apology?

Naturally, Angela says nothing.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
You always gotta get the last word, 
don't you? It's one way with you, 
Angela, isn't it? I give and I give 
and I get nothing back.

Sigfried turns to Ted.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
She just sits there waiting for me 
to jump through hoops...

Angela attempts to speak through the gag. Both men wait with 
bated breath for a response. Sigfried's had enough.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
Stupid me, for a second I thought 
you were going to say something... 
something like, "I'm sorry." HA! 
"I'm sorry." You're absolutely right, 
love cakes, I wouldn't want it that 
way. That's one thing you can say 
about Angela. She'll never do anything 
she doesn't want to do. If the feeling 
ain't there, she just isn't going to 
do it. There is nothing in this world 
as fucked as a woman who gives when 
she doesn't want to. Never let that 
happen to you, Theodore. It makes 
you feel very little indeed.

Ted beckons Sigfried.

TED
You mind if I...?

SIGFRIED
Go ahead. Spit it out.

TED
I don't mean to upset you further, 
sir, but I think she was trying to 
say yes.

SIGFRIED
Are you condescending to me, Theodore?

TED
Absolutely not, I would never do 
that.

SIGFRIED
Why don't you just say it?

TED
Say what?

SIGFRIED
That you think I'm an idiot.

TED
I would never say that.

SIGFRIED
You think you're superior to me, 
don't ya, Theodore? You don't think 
I notice there is a gag in the woman's 
mouth.

TED
Of course you do.

SIGFRIED
Naturally "of course." And do you 
know how I know that?

TED
How, sir?

SIGFRIED
Because I PUT THE GAG IN HER MOUTH! 
I'm gonna let you in on a little 
secret about communication, Theodore. 
It's all in the eyes...
(points the gun at 
Ted)
Him?
(turns the gun on 
himself)
Or me? Him or me? No one? Okay. Let's 
drag it out.

Sigfried empties the last of the pills into his mouth, heaving 
the empty bottle over his shoulder. He takes off, disappearing 
into the bathroom.

INT. ROOM

Ted finds himself alone with Angela. They lock eyes. Angela 
implores Ted to lean forward. Ted sizes up the situation: 
His chances of making it to the door are slim due to the 
fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. Ted 
paces back and forth in front of Angela, who struggles to 
get his attention. He whips around and they face off in what 
appears to be a game of charades. Ted finally gets the point 
and cautiously removes the gag from Angela's mouth. Angela 
spits an old sock out.

TED
What!

ANGELA
We don't have time to play charades 
here, asshole! Untie me quick.

TED
Listen, lady, I don't know what in 
the hell is going on here, but I'd 
appreciate it if you would explain 
to that nutcase that he's making a 
big mistake.

ANGELA
Look, whether you like it or not, 
you're in the middle of a situation 
here you can't just wish your way 
out of.

TED
But I've never seen you people before, 
we're complete strangers.

ANGELA
Everyone starts out strangers, Ted, 
it's where we end up that counts. 
Hurry up.

Ted wrestles with the idea of whether to untie Angela or 
not.

TED
I don't know if I can do this. It's 
too hard.

ANGELA
Life is hard, Ted. You ever stopped 
to consider how many times you change 
your underwear in a lifetime?

On nervous impulse, Ted begins the calculations.

ANGELA
I don't mean literally, you ignoramus.

TED
What?

ANGELA
Forget it, listen to me. There's a 
gun in my suitcase behind the bed, 
it's loaded...

TED
I'm not going to shoot anybody.

ANGELA
Fine. Get the gun and I'll shoot 
"anybody."

TED
And make me an accessory in the murder 
of your husband?

Ted collapses to his knees in front of Angela.

TED
That's not fair. It just isn't fair.

ANGELA
Get a fucking grip on yourself. First 
off, who says he's my husband? And 
second, we are a long way from fair 
here, fair is back in jolly old 
England eatin' crumpets and sipping 
on tea.

Ted collects himself.

TED
Tut. Tut. Tut. Not so fast. Well, 
maybe there are two sides to this 
thing.

ANGELA
There are two sides to a plate, still 
you only eat off of one. Now GET THE 
GUN!

TED
So why's he got you tied up?

ANGELA
I'm a werewolf, Ted! Get the gun!

Ted is at a loss as to what to do. Angela turns on the charm.

ANGELA
Come on, Ted. Come over here just 
for a minute. You can do it. Come 
on, Ted. You look like a good guy.

Ted creeps towards her.

ANGELA
That's it, Teddy. You look so much 
more attractive when you're self-
assured.

Sigfried suddenly comes to life... He's heard from the 
bathroom belting out "Life is but a dream... she-boom, she-
boom."

ANGELA
(she panics)
Quick, he's coming back. Put the gag 
back in, and remember the gun!

Ted hurries to replace the sock in her mouth.

TED
Nine thousand, three hundred and 
twenty-two times, to the best of my 
estimation.

INT. ROOM

Sigfried coughs, sending a chill up Ted's spine. Ted whips 
around to discover Sigfried leaning up against the door to 
the bathroom.

SIGFRIED
I was just beginning to think I could 
trust you, Theodore. Silly me.

Ted's fingers are frozen over Angela's lips.

TED
I was just trying to help her breathe 
a little.

SIGFRIED
Don't let me stop you, Teddy. You 
don't mind me calling you Teddy, do 
you?

TED
That's fine.

SIGFRIED
I used to have a little bunny rabbit 
named Teddy, it looked real cute 
nibbling on Angela's ear. Only problem 
here is you're no bunny rabbit, 
Theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes 
me to picture you doin' it. But don't 
let me stop you, Teddy... no need to 
play sneaky-poo.

Ted starts to back toward the door.

TED
Look, man, if this is some kind of 
Voodoo thing and you want me to have 
sex with your wife, there is 
absolutely no way.

SIGFRIED
(shouts at the top of 
his lungs)
I said, nibble, asshole! Now!

The directness of Sigfried's command, coupled with the SOUND 
of a trigger being cocked, forces Ted to approach Angela. 
Angela is a stunning beauty, and Ted being kind of a shy guy 
makes for an awkward situation. Ted leans forward. As he 
closes in, Angela's eyes close.

TED
(whispers)
Sorry, lady.

Ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on Angela.

SIGFRIED
What's the matter, no whiz left in 
the cheese? I'm not cramping your 
style, am I?

TED
Look, I'm not playing this game 
anymore.

Sigfried yanks Ted backwards. He wraps his arms around him.

SIGFRIED
It's almost all over, Theodore, and 
soon you can go home to Mommy.

Ted struggles to free himself from Sigfried's powerful bear 
hug and blasts out the following monologue.

TED
My name is not Theodore, it's TED, 
TED, TED, T... E... D... TED... NOT 
TEDDY, NOT THEODORE... TED... Yes, 
my mother did me the service of naming 
me Theodore and I haven't a clue as 
to how you know that because everyone 
who knows that lives a long way away 
from here. Do you have any idea what 
it's like to go to school where all 
the other kids' parents are in jail 
doing time for crimes like grand 
larceny, aggravated assault, burglary 
and murder, and you get stuck with a 
mother who names you Theodore and 
dressed you up in little matching 
pink outfits with, get this, a little 
blue bow fucking tie! Well, I'll 
tell you what happens. Pretty soon 
Theodore becomes "Theo the Thumper," 
and when Theo the Thumper gets old 
enough, he packs his bags and goes 
thousands of miles away where he can 
put the whole bloody mess behind 
him. So, if you don't mind, shoot me 
now, because no one is going to call 
me that again. My name is Ted, okay? 
Got it? TED!

Sigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence. 
He takes a step toward Ted and offers him his hand.

SIGFRIED
Sigfried.

TED
What?

SIGFRIED
My name is Sigfried.

TED
Sigfried?

Sigfried cuts a "Something wrong with that?" look at Ted.

SIGFRIED
Yah, Sigfried.

TED
Nice to meet you, Sigfried.

Ted cautiously takes Sigfried's hand.

SIGFRIED
Very impressive, Ted. "Theo the 
Thumper?"... Ouch. It's a deal, kid. 
Ted it will be.

TED
Thanks.

Sigfried holds onto Ted's hand. The soft sound of distant 
fireworks pops in the background. Car horns and a muffled 
countdown signal that it's New Year's.

Sigfried moves uncomfortably close to Ted and from out of 
nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on Ted's 
mouth. Something snaps in Sigfried. He is either really 
getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure. 
He doubles back on the floors. Ted and Angela watch as he 
flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all 
over the place. Ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve 
while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun.

TED
You okay, mister? I'll get help!

Sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at 
Ted. He signals for Ted to go to the bathroom.

TED
(continuing)
That's the wrong door, sir.

Sigfried grabs Ted by the leg and shove the barrel of the 
gun into his crotch.

Sigfried pulls Ted's face closer to his.

SIGFRIED
Get me the nitro... it's in the 
bathroom cabinet. Now!

Ted rushes into the bathroom, leaving Sigfried a babbling 
mess behind.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM--SAME TIME

Ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an 
earthquake. Towels and wet clothes are all over the place. 
An evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills 
are everywhere. Sigfried is shouting from the other room to 
hurry. Ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked 
"Nitro." No luck.

Ted spots a small window set above the toilet.

He figures this is the best chance he's got to make a break.

Ted goes for it. He manages to get his head and one arm 
through the window before he gets stuck. His legs dangle in 
the bathroom. Struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet-
bowl lever, which sends a loud FLUSH SOUND out through the 
apartment.

SIGFRIED (O.S.)
(shouting in the 
distance)
It's no time to take a leak, Teddy, 
I'm fucking dying here!

EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW--NIGHT

Outside the window, Ted's in another world. He's almost safe. 
It's a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water 
in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass 
off. He can see the flickering red glowing light from the 
witches' room from the floor below.

EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND BELOW--NIGHT

Ted sees Eva bopping naked past the window. He shouts her 
name out, to no avail.

The MUSIC drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for 
help. The blood rushes to his head. He lets himself hang 
there for a moment. He wonders how many other people have 
found themselves in situations like this before him. Probably 
everyone. Right next to his face, Ted recognizes a bloody 
hand print. It's not his blood.

EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW AND ABOVE--NIGHT

Ted hears a sound from above and twists himself around, 
spotting a young man (previously seen as the Yuppie Scumbag 
on the phone) leaning out of the window directly above him. 
After a quick moment of sizing him up, Ted gathers himself.

TED
Hi...

No answer. Something's wrong with the guy, all the blood is 
drained from his face and he is mumbling something.

TED
Listen, I'm stuck here in a situation 
that I can't even begin to explain, 
but would you be so kind as to get 
help? Could you call the police, 
please?

Silence.

TED
(continuing)
You okay?

The young man manages to belt out the word "ice" just before 
hurling a mouthful of vomit toward Ted. It takes all Ted's 
strength to dodge the puke and pull himself back into the 
bathroom. He falls back on the floor.

He props himself up and checks for damage. He notices 
something odd... the room is silent. No Sigfried. He walks 
into the bedroom.

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM--MOMENTS LATER

Ted looks around the still room. No one's there.

TED
Sigfried?

He heads toward the door and, from out of the corner of his 
eye, he spots Sigfried's hairy leg. Sigfried has passed out 
on the floor. Angela's chair has been knocked on its side. 
Ted races over to help lift her back up. He pulls the gag 
from her mouth. Angela jumps all over him.

ANGELA
Where's the fucking nitro?

TED
I couldn't find it!

ANGELA
You took long enough. Untie me, for 
Christ's sake, you fucking upset him 
and he's dying.

Ted struggles to untie Angela.

TED
I thought you wanted to kill him.

ANGELA
You'd make a great cop, Theodore.

The knots are all over the place and a real bitch to untie.

TED
I can't handle this alone, I'd better 
get help.

Ted turns on a dime and runs smack into Sigfried, who's been 
taking in the whole conversation.

SIGFRIED
I tie a pretty good knot, don't I, 
Ted?

TED
Thank God you're okay...

SIGFRIED
Never felt better.

Angela hears Sigfried's voice from behind her back.

ANGELA
You bastard!

SIGFRIED
(to Angela)
Come on, honey, don't get mad. It 
was just a little test, and I'm glad 
I did it because now I'll know forever 
that you really do love me. Truly 
and deeply.

ANGELA
If the simple fact that I didn't 
want your bloated, dead body lying 
out on the floor is love, then no 
wonder we find ourselves as we are 
at this very fucking moment.

SIGFRIED
Oh, no. I heard you and there was 
genuine care in that voice. Can't be 
denied. Can it, Ted?

TED
I think you're right and, if you 
just keep this kind of open dialogue 
going, you'll go a long way to 
resolving this misunderstanding.

Ted edges his way toward the door.

TED
(continuing)
You'd be surprised what happens when 
people just listen to each other 
without succumbing to all that pain 
and anger.

ANGELA
You heard shit, monkey boy. Easy for 
you to say after you fuck another 
man's wife. You should at least have 
the guts to stand by your convictions.

Sigfried turns an icy eye on Ted, who has given up all hope 
of ever getting out of the room.

TED
That's a lie, Sigfried. I swear to 
God.

Angela continues her tirade.

ANGELA
When I think of all the times you 
were inside me promising me a better 
life, it makes me want to puke.

Sigfried slowly raises his gun, pointing it directly at Ted's 
chest.

TED
Why are you doing this? What have I 
ever done to you people?

ANGELA
What didn't you do, stick man? 
Unfortunately, you don't have the 
balls to back up the actions of your 
huge cock.

The words hit Sigfried like bullets to the chest... his legs 
weaken.

SIGFRIED
(whimpering)
He's got a huge cock?

TED
She's lying again, mister. It's not 
that big.

SIGFRIED
Show it to me.

TED
Come on, man, she's lying. Can't you 
see she's fucking with you?

ANGELA
Put it this way, God made up for 
what he did to Gumby with Ted here.

SIGFRIED
Show it to me.

ANGELA
Show him your cock, Theodore.

Sigfried runs over to Angela and kneels in front of her.

SIGFRIED
Stop talking about his cock, will 
you?!

ANGELA
It's hard to stop talking about 
something so huge. I could go on and 
on about his cock, bone, nob, bishop, 
wang, thang, hotrod. Hump mobile, 
Oscar, dong, dagger, banana, cucumber, 
salami. Sausage, kielbasa, schlong, 
dink, tool, Big Ben, Mister Happy, 
prick, disk, pecker, peter, pee-pee, 
wee-wee, weiner, pisser, pistol, 
joint, hose, horn, middle-leg, third-
leg, meat, stick, joystick, dipstick.

Angela is on a roll. She fires the words at Sigfried, hitting 
him pointblank. He staggers. He pleads with her to stop, 
covering his ears. Ted watches the man crumble.

ANGELA
(continuing)
Junior, the little head, little guy, 
Rumple Foreskin, Tootsie Roll. Snake, 
one-eyed monster, one-eyed wonder, 
shaft, sword, meat whistle, skin 
flute, love muscle, Roto-Rooter, 
instrument, banger, rammer, ramrod, 
cherrypicker, log, pole.

Sigfried tries jamming the sock back in her mouth to stop 
the flow; she manages to give him a "fuck of a bite" in the 
process. Meanwhile, Ted figures this to be his moment to 
make a move and bolts for the door, only to be tackled by 
Sigfried at the one-yard line. After a struggle, the two men 
rest on the floor, catching their breath in a relaxed embrace.

SIGFRIED
Please, don't leave me. I'll call 
you Ted from now on.

TED
It's not me, mister, I swear.

SIGFRIED
Personally, I don't give a fuck, 
Ted, it's just I don't want to be 
alone right now. I'm feeling a little 
vulnerable.

Sigfried heaves the gun over his shoulder, grabs a half-empty 
bottle of Jack Daniel's, and passes it to Ted, who takes a 
hit.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
No guns, okay? Just you and me, Ted. 
You know my father used to say that 
forgiveness is the only thing that 
evil can't sink its teeth into.

TED
That's beautiful.

SIGFRIED
Kind of nice down here on the floor, 
isn't it, Ted?

TED
Yes, actually.

SIGFRIED
Things take on a whole new 
perspective... You'd like my trust, 
wouldn't you, Ted?

TED
Yes I would.

SIGFRIED
I just got one thing to ask you and 
I'll let you go.

TED
Okay. Okay.

SIGFRIED
Tell me straight now.

TED
What?

SIGFRIED
What was it like?

TED
What was what like?

SIGFRIED
You know, you and her.

TED
Oh, for fuck sake, Sigfried, what do 
you want me to say?

SIGFRIED
Either way you're fucked, right? You 
ever gonna see her again, Theodore?

TED
If I ever saw her again, I'd run the 
other way.

SIGFRIED
Promise?

TED
I promise.

Sigfried releases Ted and stands up.

SIGFRIED
You're lying, but I can respect that, 
Ted. If you told me, it would no 
longer be a secret, and secrets have 
a power, kid. You open that box and 
they disappear forever. A bad secret 
will rip you apart, but the good one 
are all you got. In the end, when 
all the people you knew are dead and 
gone, all you'll have left are you 
secrets. And when you die, the box 
is open and it all blows away -- 
dust to dust -- all the anger, 
jealousy, desire and love just blow 
away.

Sigfried throws his hand out to help Ted up.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
So you know what I say, let's call 
it a truce, kiddo.

Sigfried takes Ted by the hand and leads him to an open 
window. Ted is overcome by the sweetness in Sigfried's voice 
and follows him to the window willingly.

The two men look out into the dark Los Angeles night.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
I'm a man of love, Theodore. Love is 
all I live for.

TED
I can see that.

SIGFRIED
Maybe to a fault.

TED
Don't beat yourself up over it.

SIGFRIED
That's nice of you to say, Ted, but 
I probably should make a clean break 
of it, cut her loose and get my own 
place. I just can't imagine living 
without her. Do you think I should 
seek professional help?

TED
It's not for everyone, but maybe in 
your case it could help.

SIGFRIED
You ever been out on the ocean at 
night?

Ted shakes his head.

SIGFRIED
(continuing)
I have... scary as a motherfucker, 
all that darkness around you. It's 
like a big black carpet rolled out 
as far as the eye can see. Sometimes, 
if you're lucky, you'll see a light. 
It could be as small as a little 
spark, but it will cut a path straight 
through all that blackness, straight 
to you. It could be another boat, or 
some distant fire on an island, but 
that light will shed a shining path 
of diamonds cutting through mile 
after mile of darkness to lie at 
your feet. That's love, Ted, it's 
like a path of light in an ocean of 
darkness.

Ted and Sigfried stare out of the window in peace, transfixed 
by the glimmering lights of the city. A loud SHOT rings out, 
shattering the still moment. The two men spin around. Angela 
stands there with a smoking gun hanging at her side.

Sigfried drops to his knees. Ted checks him out, no blood. 
Angela has fired the gun into the floor below. Ted looks up 
at Angela. Angela opens the chamber of the pistol and hands 
the bullets to Ted.

ANGELA
(to Ted)
You'd better go check to see if I 
killed anybody downstairs.

Sigfried is bent over, silently weeping on the floor.

TED
You people gonna be okay?

Angela sits next to Sigfried and gently strokes his back.

ANGELA
We're fine, Ted.

Ted points to a tray with half-eaten food on it.

TED
Would you like me to...?

ANGELA
Another time, Ted.

Ted slowly walks toward the door and takes one last look at 
the strange couple at rest in the corner of the room before 
closing the door behind him.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY--MOMENTS LATER

Ted walks down the hallway, lost in thought. An energetic 
Young Guy with a bouquet of flowers plows into him.

YOUNG GUY
Happy New Year, buddy.

TED
Happy New Year.

YOUNG GUY
I was just in room 404, what a party! 
You know where room 409 is at?

TED
Beats me. It's somewhere around here.

The guy takes off in the direction Ted's walking from. Ted 
suddenly realizes who this guy is and whips around, shouting 
to the Young Guy.

TED
(continuing)
Hey, what's your name?

The door SLAMS on room 409.

FADE OUT

FADE TO BLACK

STORY TITLE CARD:

ROOM 716
"THE MISBEHAVERS"

FADE UP

THE FRONT DESK

SUPER: 10:30 p.m.

Ted is relaxing at the front desk. He breathes slowly. He 
finally has one moment's peace after an already long night. 
He even has a chance to straighten his tie.

The phone RINGS.

TED
Front desk.

CUT TO:

ROOM 716

CLOSE-UP of a cigarette hanging out of a Man's mouth as he 
speaks into the telephone.

MAN
Bottle of Moet et Chandon. Fast.

Man hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an 
already overstuffed ashtray by the bed. Man turns around to 
face the camera. He is a dark and handsome Latin male in his 
mid-30s. Dangerous. Impatient.

He walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his 
tie.

He stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his Wife 
and two kids get ready for the party. Wife seems to be a 
beautiful woman in her mid-30s. The children are Sarah, nine, 
and Juancho, six.

Man strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie.

He watches his Wife comb Juancho's hair down and to the side 
like an idiot.

Not being able to stand it anymore, Man tears Juancho away 
from his Wife and snatches the comb.

MAN
Give me that...

Man begins to slick Juancho's hair back.

MAN
There... see? You look cool with 
your hair up like this. Like me...

Juancho is smiling now. He's happy he's going to look like 
his dad.

MAN
Not down and to the side, all stupid 
like your mom likes to comb it.

Juancho looks over at Sarah, who is going through the tortuous 
ritual of having her mother brush the tangles out of her 
long, unmanageable hair.

Wife seems to be taking out her aggressions on the tangled 
mess.

Man is starting to have problems of his own with Juancho's 
hair. Juancho's hair is thinner than Man's, so it won't stay 
up.

Man puts down his cigarette in order to get a better handle 
on it. We see the frustration growing in his face.

Juancho picks up the cigarette and pretends he's smoking 
too, just like his dad.

Man tears the cigarette away from Juancho and smokes it down 
to the filter. He looks at his own cool hair, and then down 
at Juancho's, which won't stay up.

Man flicks the cigarette butt into the toilet in frustration. 

MAN
You've got your mother's hair.

In anger, Man starts messing up Juancho's hair.

MAN
I can't do anything with it.

Furious, Man simply swipes Juancho's hair back down and to 
the side, the way Wife had it before. Juancho looks like an 
idiot again.

MAN
There. Go.

Juancho slouches past everyone as he exits the bathroom.

Sarah watches him leave as her own hair is finished.

WIFE
(putting a plastic 
clip in Sarah's hair)
There. Go.

Sarah exits.

Wife then finishes her own gorgeous hair. Man lights up a 
new cigarette.

WIFE
(mocking)
So, are we gonna have fun tonight?

Man blows smoke in Wife's face as he walks out of the 
bathroom.

WIFE
I didn't think so.

Sarah has joined Juancho in watching television.

Man watches the children watch TV. We can see the wheels 
turning in Man's head.

He turns back to the bathroom.

He watches Wife now. Wheels turning. Practically burning 
rubber.

MAN
Hey.

Wife puts the lipstick down and turns to her husband. She is 
beautiful.

MAN
(shrugs)
Let's just leave the kids here.

Wife glances out at the children, eyes glued to the tube.

WIFE
Here in the room? By themselves?

MAN
No... with the television.

Wife thinks about it for a second. She shrugs a "sure."

MAN
You want to have fun tonight, don't 
you?

WIFE
Yes.

MAN
They'll be fine.

He kisses Wife's face and exits the bathroom. She covers the 
wet spot with more cake makeup.

MAN
Hey.

The children turn to face him.

MAN
You guys are going to stay here and 
watch TV.

The children look at each other.

MAN
I want you to be in bed asleep before 
twelve. Your mother and I will be 
back later on.

Wife goes straight for the door.

MAN
Okay?

He blows one kiss. One for both of them.

As Man and his Wife walk out the door, Man turns back to the 
children...

MAN
Don't misbehave.

He closes the door.

Sarah stands in the middle of the room. She's looking at the 
door Man and Wife just disappeared through. Stunned.

Her dress looks frilly and beautifully uncomfortable. She 
touches the edges of the fabric.

SARAH
Why did we have to get all dressed 
up if we weren't going with them?

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY

Man and Wife are walking down the hall.

Man stops in his tracks. Wife stops too and looks at Man. 
They wait.

CUT TO:

ROOM 716

Juancho shuts off the television. He drops the remote to the 
floor. His attention is on the fireworks outside. He leaps 
to the window and begins unlatching it.

SARAH
What are you doing?

JUANCHO
Escaping. Stinks in here, anyway.

Man bursts through the door of the hotel room and stands in 
the doorway, glaring at the mischievous Juancho.

Juancho bangs his head on the window trying to get back 
inside. He leaps to the floor and tries to turn on the TV 
with the remote.

MAN
(stern)
What did I say?

Juancho turns to Man as if he'd been sitting there watching 
television the whole time.

MAN
Behave.

JUANCHO
Yes, Papa.

Ted appears at the door with Man's champagne.

TED
The champagne you ordered, sir.

MAN
No time for this. Leave it on ice.

Ted proceeds to place the champagne in the room.

WIFE
But I want some now...

Ted is torn. Man pushes him into the room.

MAN
There'll be plenty for you and the 
party, baby, you can bomb yourself 
all you want at the party.

WIFE
What a waste.

Ted places the bucket near the bed. After setting up the 
bottle, he turns to leave, but now Man closes the door, 
trapping Ted inside with them.

MAN
(to Ted)
Hey.

Ted looks around, bewildered. Now what?

Man is reaching into his coat pocket.

MAN
You want five hundred bucks?

TED
Sure!

Man hesitates a moment, then pulls out his wallet. That was 
too easy.

MAN
How about three?

TED
Three hundred?

MAN
Yeah.

TED
Three's good.

MAN
My children are staying here tonight 
watching TV. I want you to check up 
on them every thirty minutes.

TED
Check up on 'em?

MAN
Make sure they're all right, make 
sure they're fed, make sure they go 
to bed.

TED
We can call out and hire a babysitter.

MAN
I don't trust babysitters. My children 
are safer alone than with some fucked-
up pedophile babysitter I don't know 
from the man in the fucking moon.

WIFE
What about him? What makes you think 
you can trust him?

Man grabs Ted's face and tilts it torward Wife.

MAN
Tell me that's not a face you can 
trust.

Man lets go of Ted's face. He feels his jaw. It's still there.

TED
Look, sir, I'd like to help you out, 
but I really can't. I'm all alone 
here tonight.

Man whips out his wallet and counts out money in Ted's face.

MAN
One hundred... two hundred... three 
hundred...

TED
I thought you said five hundred.

Man glares at Ted.

MAN
I said three hundred.

Ted doesn't back down.

TED
No, you distinctly said five hundred.

The angrier Man gets, the quieter he talks.

MAN
You calling me a liar?

Ted, while not backing down, massages the situation.

TED
No, I'm not saying you're lying. I'm 
saying you accidentally forgot that 
what you first said was five hundred.

Man has never been challenged like this by a fuckin' bellboy.

MAN
I don't do anything accidentally, 
jerk. I might've first said five 
hundred, but what I last said was 
three hundred, and what you say last 
is what counts.

Ted not only doesn't back down, but psychologically pokes 
his finger in the scary Man's chest.

TED
Well then, if you say five hundred 
one last time, we got a deal.

Man's eyes narrow. He physically pokes his finger in Ted's 
chest.

MAN
You fuckin' with me, Pendejo?

Now Ted takes a step backwards.

TED
No, not at all. It's New Year's Eve 
and I'm here alone. If there was 
somebody else here, no problem, but 
I'm by myself. And looking after 
your kids is a pain in the ass I 
don't need --

MAN
You callin' my kids a pain in the 
ass?

TED
-- No, they're not a pain in the 
ass, it's the situation that's a 
pain in the ass.

Man drops the tenseness.

MAN
No, you were right the first time. 
You win, tough guy, five hundred.

Man respects Ted for not backing down, but not insulting him 
either. A skill Man never learned. Wife shoots a look at the 
children.

WIFE
(disgusted)
You kids are getting expensive.

Juancho turns back to the TV.

Sarah stares down Wife.

MAN
(looking at name tag)
What's your name? Ted?

CLOSE-UP of name tag.

TED
Yeah. It's Ted.

Man tears off Ted's name tag and throws it to children.

MAN
(to the children)
His name is Ted. If you need anything, 
dial 0 and ask for Ted.

Sarah catches the name tag and reads the name on it: "TED -- 
BELLHOP."

Sarah looks up at Ted. She clips the pin to her dress and 
smiles shyly at him.

Man puts the money in Ted's pocket and then grabs his ear, 
pulling him close.

MAN
(deadly whisper)
If something happens to my children, 
I wouldn't want to be you.

WIFE
Make sure they're in bed before 
midnight.

TED
(thinking)
Before midnight? Then should I wake 
them up for the countdown to the New 
Year?

Wife looks disgusted.

WIFE
No...

As Man and Wife exit, he turns to the kids and says:

MAN
Don't misbehave.

Man closes the door.

INT. HALLWAY

Man and Wife book it down the hall before Ted can change his 
mind.

ROOM 716

Ted is standing facing the door the Man and Wife just 
disappeared through. He turns around slowly to face the 
children.

His eyes are wide. His face is quiet. Stern.

The children are staring at him.

TED
Okay. These are the rules. Don't 
break the rules and I won't break 
your necks.

The kids look at each other.

TED
(smiling)
I always wanted to say that. Someone 
said that to me when I was a kid.

Sarah laughs at his joke.

TED
Except they were joking. I'm not.

Ted goes to the door.

TED
The rules are simple. Don't do 
anything you wouldn't do if your 
parents were here. If there's an 
emergency, call me on the phone, 
like your dad said.

SARAH
That's not what he said.

Ted's surprised by a challenge this early in the game.

SARAH
He said to call if we need anything.

TED
Well, I've got a lot of work to do 
and I can't have you calling me every 
time you want a drink of water, so 
please limit your calls to emergencies 
only.

SARAH
We paid you five hundred dollars. 
We'll call you if we need anything. 
You don't want to upset my dad.

TED
Okay. Please. Try to call only when 
necessary. Watch TV, and if you're 
good, I'll bring up some milk and 
cookies. Bye.

Ted leaves.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY

Ted walks briskly down the hall, counting his money the whole 
way.

CUT TO:

INT. ROOM

Juancho takes off his socks and shoes and throws them onto 
the floor. Sarah looks at the discarded shoes and socks.

CLOSE ON the shoes and socks.

Sarah looks over at Juancho's bare feet. Her nose twitches.

SARAH
Your feet stink.

Juancho smells his feet.

JUANCHO
They don't stink.

Sarah throws his shoes and socks behind her. They land on 
the bed.

Juancho is flipping channels and finds an interesting show.

JUANCHO
Check it out. T & A.

Sarah realizes he found a Nudie station.

SARAH
Change it. You're not supposed to 
watch this.

JUANCHO
We're supposed to watch TV.

SARAH
Not this kind of TV. Change it.

Juancho rolls up in a ball, the remote tucked in some recess 
of his stomach.

Sarah hits him, then goes to the phone. She punches 0, sits 
on the bed, and checks the name on the name tag pinned to 
her shirt.

CUT TO:

FRONT DESK

Ted walks up to the front desk just as the phone rings.

TED
Front desk.

INT. ROOM

Sarah is taking off her white winter tights.

SARAH
Ted? Hi. It's me, Sarah. You're our 
sitter for tonight.

TED
Oh, Jesus, what did I tell you? I 
said if you don't bother me, you'll 
get milk and cookies. Now, do you 
want them or do you not?

SARAH
I want you to turn off the Nudie 
station in our room.

Ted checks the computer.

TED
(reading stats on 
room 716)
I can't turn on an adult station 
without permission from your parents.

SARAH
No.
(struggling with winter 
tights)
Not turn it on, turn it off. It's 
already on.

TED
That's not what the machine tells 
me.

SARAH
Well, stop listening to the machine 
and listen to me. There's naked ladies 
dancing on my TV and I want 'em off.

TED
If you're good, you'll get milk and 
cookies, so leave me alone, please. 
I'll be up later to put you both to 
sleep.

He hangs up.

ROOM 716

Angry, Sarah slams down the phone. She has an unusually adult 
temper. We know where she gets it from. She looks up and 
sees that the nudies are still in full force.

SARAH
Change the channel, now!

Juancho turns around. He has a face like someone just laid a 
fart in his nose.

JUANCHO
Man, you're the one with the stinky 
feet.

Sarah smells her feet. Twice.

SARAH
They don't stink.

JUANCHO
Yeah, they do.

SARAH
Here, smell for yourself.

She sticks her foot out for Juancho to smell. He's reluctant. 
Fearful.

SARAH
Go ahead.

He slowly, very slowly... climbs onto the bed and lowers his 
head to her foot. Very slowly.

Sarah waits until he's close enough to her foot before she 
kicks him in the face, sending him somersaulting off the bed 
and crashing to the floor.

She grabs the remote control he left behind and changes the 
channel to a cartoon.

Juancho gets up and realizes his defeat. He decides to wander 
about. Looking for something to do...

Sarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room. It's only a 
matter of time before he finds mischief.

Juancho sees the champagne bucket and Bingo!, he goes for 
the bottle.

JUANCHO
(holding up the bottle)
Hey, get a bottle opener!

Sarah opens her mouth, as if about to tell him to leave the 
champagne alone. She stops herself when she realizes she 
wants some champagne too.

She quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while Juancho 
unwraps the bottle top.

Sarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few 
hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer 
slide forward.

Some coins, a paperclip, and a hypodermic needle. She looks 
down at the needle that lays beside the Gideon Bible and 
casually picks the phone back up and punches 0. The phone 
rings.

FRONT DESK

Ted, bucket of ice in his hand, gets ready to go to room 
404. As he crosses the desk, the phone rings. He looks at 
the board and see room 716's light blinking.

He sighs in exasperation.

INT. ROOM

Sarah sees Juancho shaking the champagne bottle violently.

SARAH
Don't shake it!
(into phone)
Ted? Hi. It's me. Sarah.

TED
Yeah. Who died? No one? Then don't 
call me.

SARAH
I thought I'd tell you that your 
cleaning ladies are doing a bum job. 
There's all kinds of leftover stuff 
around here.

Sarah picks up the needle and rolls it over in her hand 
several times.

SARAH
Needles and things. We're not supposed 
to have needles here, are we? I mean, 
they don't come with the room, do 
they? Send someone up here to clean 
this place up right.

The champagne bottle explodes all over Juancho. He looks 
surprised.

SARAH
(to Juancho)
I TOLD YOU NOT TO SHAKE IT!
(to Ted)
I gotta go. My brother just exploded 
the champagne all over the room. Oh, 
and bring us a couple of toothbrushes. 
There's a card in the bathroom that 
says you'll bring free toothbrushes 
if we ask for them.

She hangs up.

A frustrated Ted hangs up the phone. He walks briskly to the 
elevator.

Sarah and Juancho are pouring themselves champagne. They 
turn up the television and drink. Juancho shudders at the 
taste, but tries to drink as much as Sarah.

Sarah clearly doesn't like it, but tries to pretend she does.

Sarah picks up an instruction card near the phone to see how 
to make room-to-room calls.

SARAH
I'm calling another room, give me 
three numbers.

JUANCHO
4-0-9.

Sarah punches in the room number. The phone rings.

She holds the needle up to the light to examine it.

SARAH
Hello? Hi. You don't know me, and I 
don't know you, but... do you have 
any needles? We've got needles here 
and I was wondering if they come 
with the room or not. Don't have 
any? Thanks. Just checking.

She hangs up.

Juancho puts down his champagne glass and searches his 
father's coat pocket. He finds a pack of cigarettes and takes 
one out. He puts it in his mouth and pretends to smoke.

Sarah checks out the hypodermic needle carefully. She has an 
idea.

MONTAGE:

In the bathroom, Sarah seeks out her mother's lipstick.

ROOM 716

Sarah stands atop the chest of drawers and uses the lipstick 
to draw a bull's-eye on one of the hotel art paintings. She 
writes numbers next to each circle representing points.

Juancho is standing at the foot of the bed, cigarette hanging 
out of his mouth, as he practices his dart-throwing technique.

SARAH
(pointing out the 
rules)
The center is the bull's eye, 100 
points, this one's 10 points, this 
one's 20 points.

WHACK! The needle lands an inch from her face in the 20-point 
slot.

SARAH
Hey, wait a minute. Let me get out 
of the way!

Sarah, a little tipsy now, grabs the needle and staggers to 
the bed. She hears the key in the doorway and throws the 
needle into the curtain to hide it.

Ted enters the room, somewhat disheveled from his encounter 
with Sigfried. He has a tray and a new bottle of champagne.

He puts the champagne bottle into the empty bucket. He spots 
the original bottle lying on the floor half empty and dripping 
into the carpet.

TED
I brought you some milk and cookies. 
If you want some you have to eat 
them now, because you're going to 
sleep.

SARAH
We're going to sleep now?

TED
Your parents said put you to bed 
before midnight. Well, it's before 
midnight. Maybe that way you'll leave 
me alone.

SARAH
Those aren't milk and cookies.

TED
We were out of cookies, so I brought 
you milk and Saltines. Don't complain! 
Now hurry up and eat. You're going 
to bed right now.

Juancho bites into a Saltine. Sarah simply examines one.

JUANCHO
These are old.

SARAH
They're stale.

TED
(impatient)
Dip 'em in the milk! The milk will 
make them soft.

Sarah gives up and throws the cracker back onto the tray. 
She's a little drunk.

Ted picks up the ruined champagne bottle.

Juancho dips his crackers and eats them. He makes a face and 
drops a soggy cracker onto the tray.

TED
No crackers? Okay, fine. Sleepy time. 
Now, I don't want you guys wandering 
around, so if you need to go to the 
restroom, go now.

They go to the bathroom. Ted sits on the bed. Waits.

He sees the painting on the wall but can't figure out what's 
different about it.

The red lipstick blends right into the aesthetic value of 
the painting.

Ted smells something funny. He looks down and sees the socks 
on the bed. He grabs a fork from the tray and uses it to 
throw the socks across the room.

The kids come back out.

JUANCHO
What about our pajamas?

TED
You wanna look nice in case there's 
an earthquake, don'tcha?

The children nod.

TED
Okay. Then stay in those clothes.

The kids lie on the bed.

Sarah notices a jar of Mentholatum ointment on the dinner 
tray.

SARAH
What's that?

TED
Oh, this is just some Mentholatum 
ointment. Come on, under the covers. 
Close your eyes and I'll tell you a 
story.

The children close their eyes. Ted opens the jar of the 
ointment and sniffs it.

Strong stuff by the look on his face.

TED
Your dad says he doesn't trust 
babysitters. I don't blame him. You 
know what my babysitter did to me 
once?
(confiding)
I never told my parents, either.

The children lie in the bed, eyes closed, listening intently.

Ted dips his fingers in the jar of vaporous ointment.

TED
I hated going to sleep. You know, 
it's nighttime and you wanna run 
around and act crazy. So what my 
babysitter did to make sure I'd go 
to sleep and not be tempted to get 
up, was, she'd take some of this 
vapor rub stuff... Can you smell 
this?

Eyes closed, the kids inhale. They smell the ointment and 
nod yes.

TED
Well, she'd just dab a little of 
this over each eyelid, so that I 
would be sure and keep my eyes closed 
all night.

Ted is spreading the ointment over their eyelids as he says 
this.

TED
There. Now you've got some, too! 
Don't open your eyes or it'll burrrn, 
burn, burn. The smell helps clear 
your sinuses too, so it's doing double 
duty.

JUANCHO
What happens when it's morning?

TED
If you keep your eyes closed all 
night, it will wear off by morning. 
But DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES BEFORE 
THAT...

SARAH
Did you ever open your eyes?

Extreme CLOSE-UP on Ted's eyes.

TED
Yes... I did.

The children are quiet.

TED
And now look at me.

CHILDREN
(in unison)
We can't.

TED
Good. You'll do just fine. Sleep 
well and I won't tell your parents 
about the champagne.

Ted leaves.

CUT TO:

AFTER A MOMENT OF DARKNESS

After a moment of darkness, the night is disturbed by the 
loud crashing of fireworks outside the window.

Sarah sits up, eyes closed. Her face feels the warmth coming 
from the window and she tilts her head toward it.

The light of the fireworks dances its reflections off her 
face.

She inhales deeply... then makes a sour face. She goes for 
the bathroom, arms outstretched like a blind girl. She gets 
to the bathroom, turns on the light, and searches for the 
sink.

She begins to wash the ointment off her eyes very carefully. 
She dries her eyes thoroughly and opens them... checks them 
in the mirror. A little red, but otherwise fine.

She goes back into the bedroom, turns on the television and 
grabs the new champagne bottle. She shakes it violently.

Juancho wakes. He turns his head to her. His eyes are still 
closed.

JUANCHO
Are you watching TV?

The champagne bottle explodes. She pours herself a glass.

SARAH
Yep. If you wanna watch too, you 
have to go wash your face.

Juancho gets up smiling and tries to run to the bathroom. He 
slams into the wall, hard.

SARAH
Be careful...

Juancho walks into the bathroom a little slower, more 
cautious.

Sarah pours herself another glass. She downs the glass and 
shudders.

She smells the bad smell again. Only now she really smells 
it.

She smells her feet. Nothing. She smells the champagne. 
Nothing.

Juancho enters the room and sits on the bed. Sarah grabs his 
foot and smells it.

She drops his foot.

Juancho stares blankly at her.

Sarah looks down at the mattress. She smells the mattress.

Juancho looks at her as if she's drunk.

Sarah leaps off the bed and turns on the room lights. She 
takes a huge swig from the champagne bottle, then stalks 
toward the mattress.

Juancho leaps off the bed as well and stands back.

Sarah pulls the mattress off of the bedsprings enough to see 
what is underneath it.

Juancho screams. Sarah is too stunned to scream. Stuffed 
into the bedsprings is a woman's dead and beaten corpse.

CUT TO:

CLOSE ON

Ted's phone ringing.

Ted looks at the phone as if pondering whether or not to 
answer it. He taps his fingers. Finally he answers the phone.

ROOM 716

SARAH
Ted!

TED
What do you want now, for Christ's 
sake! Who died?

SARAH
(near tears)
I don't know, but she's in my bed!

TED
What?

SARAH
There's a dead body in my bed!

TED
That's just your brother. Sound 
asleep.

SARAH
No, there's a woman's dead body inside 
the bed, in the mattress.

TED
You saw the body?

SARAH
Yes!

TED
Impossible. You've got ointment on 
your eyes! You can't see shit! Now 
go to sleep!

Ted hangs up the phone.

Sarah redials.

Ted answers.

TED
Godammit, go to sleep!

SARAH
(crying now)
I washed it off...

TED
You washed off the ointment?

SARAH
(pissed, drunk)
Yeah, didn't you ever think to do 
that?

Ted is quiet on the line. Thinking.

Juancho lights up a cigarette for real and takes nervous 
puffs.

Sarah carries the phone over to Juancho and snatches the 
cigarette away from him. She stuffs it in her own mouth and 
nervously takes a long drag on it.

SARAH
(through cigarette)
You never tried it, did you? Then 
you agree I'm smarter than you...

TED
All right. Now you listen to me...

SARAH
Get your ass up here and call the 
police, because there's a dead body 
in my bed and it smells like shit 
and it looks even worse, and if you 
don't help us, my dad is gonna lay 
you down right next to her, I swear 
to fucking God!

She drinks from her champagne bottle. She's pulling the 
mattress back over the corpse again.

JUANCHO
Go, sis.

She's drunk all right.

TED
(incensed)
I'm coming up and if there isn't a 
dead body by the time I get there, 
I'll make one myself. You!

FRONT DESK

Ted slams down the phone.

As he walks away from the counter, he spots the children's 
parents driving up to the valet out front.

TED
Oh shit!

Ted breaks into a sprint and dives into a closing elevator.

CUT TO:

ROOM 716

Sarah continues to cover the body with the mattress.

ELEVATOR

Close on Ted's face as the elevator car races up seven floors.

LOBBY

The Man is carrying his drunk Wife through the lobby. Not 
happy.

ROOM 716

Ted bursts into the room. He sees the disarray.

Ted pushes the champagne out of Sarah's hand, spilling it 
onto the floor.

TED
What the fuck is going on??!!

He sees Juancho with the cigarette hanging out of his mouth 
and rips it away from him. The butt goes flying onto the 
carpet near the spreading champagne spill.

TED
Your parents are on their way up and 
I'm not taking responsibility for 
this mess!

SARAH
Check under the mattress!

TED
For what?

SARAH
(crying)
For the body, can't you smell it?

TED
It's your feet!

Sarah grabs the mattress and pulls it off herself.

Ted sees the rotting corpse.

Vomit spews out of Ted's mouth.

TED
(gurgles through vomit-
spewing lips)
Jesus fucking Christ! What the fuck 
is this?

He tears at the phone.

TED
(into the phone)
Police, it's an emergency!
(pause)
Hello, Police, this is the Mon Signor 
Hotel, get someone up here right 
fucking now, there's a DEAD WHORE 
stuffed under the mattress!

Tears well in Sarah's eyes as she looks at the body.

SARAH
Don't call her that...

TED
(into the phone)
I'm dead fucking serious, there's a 
dead fucking Whore stuffed in the 
bedsprings of the fucking bed!

SARAH
Stop calling her that!!

Sarah grabs the hypodermic needle from under the curtain and 
stabs it into Ted's leg.

TED
FUCK!!

Sarah steps back, almost tripping over the champagne bottle. 
She picks up the bottle and holds it defensively in case Ted 
tries to retaliate. Ted spins around, now noticing the needle 
sticking out of his leg.

TED
Jesus!!

Juancho lights up another cigarette.

The champagne spill has spread to the fallen cigarette butt. 
The carpet bursts into flames around the spill.

CUT OUTSIDE TO:

EXT. ROOM

CLOSE ON a key going into the keyhole outside.

BACK TO:

ROOM 716

Ted tries to pull the syringe out of his leg, but yanking it 
makes it break in two, the plunger in his hand, and the needle 
still stuck in his leg.

Ted staggers and grabs hold of the dead woman's foot for 
support as he steps on the remote control, flipping the TV 
on to the Nudie channel, just as...

Man opens the door.

Man stands at the door, drunk Wife unconscious on one arm, 
the door knob in the other hand. He's looking mean.

Man's POV: focused on the dead woman in the bedsprings. We 
pan up the dead woman's leg to find Ted holding her foot. We 
pan down Ted's leg to find the hypodermic needle jutting 
out... then pan over to the other hand holding the broken 
syringe plunger.

We pan over to the Nudie channel, then down to the fire 
blazing behind the children. Pan up to the dripping champagne 
bottle in Sarah's hand, then over to the cigarette hanging 
out of Juancho's mouth. Juancho tosses his cigarette out of 
his mouth to an area behind him. Another blaze starts 
immediately.

Man drops his Wife to the floor.

In the WIDE SHOT of Ted and the children, we see that the 
fireworks are bursting big and bright outside the window 
behind them. Almost as bright as the flames eating through 
the room.

Man simply glares at Ted. Finally Man speaks...

MAN
Did they misbehave?

Ted stares blankly at Man (the camera) as the sprinklers 
burst on... drenching the room as the picture

FADES TO BLACK

FOUR ROOMS

FADE UP ON

INT. HOTEL LOBBY--NIGHT

SUPER: ONE MINUTE AFTER ROBERT'S STORY. TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE 
DAWN.

The elevator rides down to the lobby. The doors open and a 
wet, disheveled, and frantic Ted steps out.

He staggers across the lobby to the reception desk. He grabs 
the phone.

INT. BETTY'S APT--ALMOST DAWN

The wild New Year's Eve party is winding down. Some Guests 
are passed out, some are asleep, some are making out, two 
guys are playing Nintendo, a Girl watches them. The phone 
RINGS. The Girl, who wears a "Guinness Stout" T-shirt, answers 
the phone.

GUINNESS GIRL
Happy New Year!

BACK TO TED: BACK AND FORTH

TED
Let me speak to Betty.

GUINNESS GIRL
Party's over, she probably went home.

TED
She lives there.

GUINNESS GIRL
Oh, well, I haven't seen 'em in a 
while.

TED
Do you even know who I'm talking 
about?

GUINNESS GIRL
Yeah... yeah... yeah... I know 'em, 
I know Eddy.

TED
Betty, not Eddy.

GUINNESS GIRL
Yeah... yeah... I know Betty too... 
Tall...

TED
No, not particularly. She's got curly 
red hair.

GUINNESS GIRL
No, no, no, no, no, I know, I know. 
Japanese girl.

TED
She's not Japanese! I just said she 
had red hair.

GUINNESS GIRL
Yeah... yeah... yeah... I know her.

TED
Well, then get her on the phone, 
it's an emergency.

GUINNESS GIRL
Who -- who should I say's calling?

TED
Tell 'em Teddy from work's on the 
phone, and it's a major fuckin' 
emergency.

GUINNESS GIRL
Gotcha, Betty from work.

TED
Not Betty from work, I'm calling 
Betty! I'm Teddy. Just say Ted.

GUINNESS GIRL
Hi, Ted, I'm Margaret. You sound 
down. Has this not been the happiest 
of New Year's?

TED
(resigning himself to 
talking with Margaret)
No Margaret, this hasn't been my 
best New Year. This year's starting 
off pretty badly.

MARGARET
Awww, how come?

TED
Well, Betty -- the chick whose house 
you're at, even though you don't 
know her -- leaves me here all by 
myself on New Year's Eve. And first 
thing right off the bat, I'm fucked 
by a coven of witches.

MARGARET
An oven full of witches fucked you? 
Is that like at the circus when they 
stick all those clowns in an itty-
bitty car?

TED
A coven. A coven of witches. Well, 
one witch in particular.

MARGARET
Was she an old hag with a mole, with 
hair growing out of it?

TED
No-no-no, she was... quite beautiful.

Margaret thinks for a moment.

MARGARET
Ted?

TED
Yes.

MARGARET
What's the problem?

TED
Well, admittedly, that was the best 
part of the night. It was pretty 
fuckin' cool, actually. But it was 
still an unnerving way to start off 
the night.

MARGARET
Sounds to me like a pretty great way 
to start off the night.

TED
Okay, let's just skip over the 
witches.

MARGARET
-- Skipping over the witches.

TED
So, later, in another room, some 
crazy sucking maniac sticks a gun in 
my face and forces me to play out 
some psychosexual drama with his 
wife.

MARGARET
He made you have psycho sex with his 
wife?

TED
No, he didn't make me fuck his wife, 
he thought I'd fucked his wife! He 
held me at gunpoint with a loaded 
gun!

MARGARET
What kinda gun?

TED
I don't know, I'm not a gun guy. It 
was big.

MARGARET
Like Dirty Harry's gun.

TED
Yeah, something like that.

MARGARET
Did it have a real long barrel or a 
short barrel?

TED
What difference does it make?

MARGARET
Well, for one thing it's the 
difference between a .44 Magnum and 
a Magnum .357.

TED
Who cares if it was a .44 or a .392, 
it was a fuckin' loaded gun, pointed 
at my fuckin' head!

Margaret takes this in.

MARGARET
You wanna skip over this part, too?

TED
I want you to get Betty on the phone!

MARGARET
Hold on.
(yelling to the room)
Anybody live here named...
(to Ted)
What's her name again?

TED
Betty.

MARGARET
Betty!

The sleepy room stirs. Betty wakes up from the floor.

BETTY
Yeah, whatcha screamin' about?

MARGARET
You're Betty?

BETTY
Yeah, I'm Betty, it's my fuckin' 
place, who the fuck are you?

MARGARET
I'm Margaret
(hands her the phone)
And this is Ted.

Betty takes the phone.

BETTY
Ted, what's the problem?

TED
What's the problem? I don't got a 
problem, I got fuckin' problems! 
Wanna hear?

BETTY
(yawning, wiping sleep 
from her eyes)
Sure.

TED
Well, most recently, there's room 
716. There's a scary Mexican gangster 
dude pokin' his finger in my chest. 
There's his hooligan kids snapping 
their fingers at me. There's the 
putrid rotting corpse of a dead whore 
stuffed in the springs of a bed. 
There're rooms blazing afire... 
There's a needle from God knows where 
stuck in my leg, infecting me with 
God knows what, and finally, there's 
me walking out the fuckin' door right 
now! Buenas noches.

A RINGING SOUND happens that we haven't heard before. Ted's 
head turns toward it.

It's the guest board. And the top light, the penthouse, is 
ringing. It rings where all the others buzzed.

Betty can hear it distinctly on her side of the line. The 
sound fully wakes her up. They start talking Howard Hawks 
style again.

BETTY
(suddenly alert)
Is that the penthouse?

TED
Yeah.

BETTY
That's the Chester Rush party, they 
want something.

TED
Yeah, well, tough titty. They're 
just gonna have to wait, 'cause I'm 
out the door.

BETTY
(panicking)
Now, Ted, wait a minute. I know you're 
freaked, I know you're stressed. 
You've had a real bad night --

TED
Yes, Betty, I've had-a-real-bad-night --

BETTY
-- You say there's a dead body in a 
room?

TED
Yes, I did.

BETTY
No problem, this is a hotel, we've 
had dead bodies before, it's just 
the price of doing business. You 
said the hotel was on fire. Is it 
still on fire?

TED
No, it's out.

BETTY
Good, sprinkler system worked like a 
charm. Now, you wanna leave, you've 
had enough. Perfectly understandable. 
I'll take care of everything else. 
The only thing I ask is that you 
take care of Chester Rush. Then you 
can leave.

TED
Now, look --

BETTY
Ted, he's a very important guest of 
this hotel. In fact, he is the most 
important guest at the hotel. The 
Mon Signor used to be a haven for 
movie stars. Through the thirties 
and forties, and the first half of 
the fifties, more movie stars -- if 
you break it down on a night-by-night 
basis -- stayed at the Mon Signor 
than any other hotel in Hollywood. 
Now, we had some hard time in the 
eighties, even though we were the 
official hotel of Cannon Pictures, 
but we're coming back strong in the 
nineties. And a movie star clientele 
is important to that comeback. If we 
can keep stars of his magnitude happy, 
we're on our way. So, Ted, just take 
care of him, then you can leave.

TED
Look, I don't feel like --

BETTY
He probably just wants some champagne! 
You can do that, can't you? Please 
just take care of him, the entire 
staff of the Mon Signor is begging 
you!

Ted crumbles.

TED
Okay. But get your ass here pronto.

BETTY
You're a good man, Ted. Thanks.

Ted hangs up the phone. And picks up the board phone.

TED
Hello, Mr. Rush. Sorry for the delay. 
How can I help you?

FADE TO BLACK

STORY TITLE CARD:

THE PENTHOUSE
"THE MAN FROM HOLLYWOOD"

EXT. HALLWAY TO PENTHOUSE--NIGHT

The elevator door opens and Ted wheels out his tray into the 
hallway.

There's been a bit of an effort to make himself appear a bit 
less disheveled than in the last scene. He's only minorly 
successful in the attempt. His uniform still looks like shit, 
his hair looks tousled, and he walks with a limp.

He wheels the cart up to the penthouse door and KNOCKS at 
the door.

A woman opens the door, it's Angela from Alex's story.

ANGELA
Hi, Theodore.

TED
What the hell are you doing here?

She holds up the drink she has in her hand.

ANGELA
Having a drink.

TED
Is that crazy husband of yours in 
there?

ANGELA
Are you kidding, he'll be asleep 
till Christmas.

From behind her we hear:

VOICE (O.S.)
Entrez, entrez.

Angela steps aside and Ted wheels in the tray.

INT. PENTHOUSE--NIGHT

The penthouse is huge, far and away the best suite in the 
house. And standing in the middle of the biggest room in the 
hotel is the hottest, newest comedy star to burst onto the 
Hollywood scene in nearly a decade: Chester Rush. At this 
moment in time, he's the king, and he has the swagger of a 
new king. After only one movie, he's pulled the sword out of 
the stone. And the look on his face says, "King's good." 
Surrounding him is his entourage. They all look like once 
upon a time this evening they were dressed sharp; however, 
at this late hour, everybody looks about as disheveled as 
Ted.

One of the lads, Norman, has planted roots in a comfy chair 
with his leg thrown over the arm and a bottle of Jim Beam in 
his hand.

The second guy, Leo, is in the back of the room pacing back 
and forth on the telephone. He is completely oblivious to 
the rest of the room's activity.

In Chester's hand is an ever present glass of champagne, 
which he constantly spills as he gestures wildly. Around the 
room are the leftovers: pizza boxes, fast-food hamburgers, 
and empty bottles of Cristal Champagne.

CHESTER
(still sitting)
Entrez, entrez, come in, come in.

TED
(wheeling in the tray)
Hi, sorry I took so long, but I got 
everything you asked for --

CHESTER
-- Not a problem, my friend Mr. 
Bellboy.

ANGELA
(closing the door)
His name's Theodore.

TED
Actually, it's not Theodore,
(he throws a look at 
Angela)
It's Ted.

Chester rises from the couch.

CHESTER
So, Ted the Bellboy, as I was saying -- 
would you care for some champagne? 
That's not what I was saying, but 
would you care for some champagne?

TED
No, thank you.

CHESTER
Ya sure? Cristal. It's the best. I 
never liked champagne before I had 
Cristal, now I love it.

TED
Okay, yeah, sure.

As Chester goes and pours Ted a glass:

CHESTER
-- As I was saying, Ted, don't worry 
about being late. For our purposes, 
promptness is far behind thoroughness.

On "thoroughness," he hands Ted the glass.

CHESTER
Chin-chin.

They clink glasses and drink.

CHESTER
Whadya say, Ted?

TED
Thank you?

CHESTER
No, not thank you. Whadya say about 
the tasty beverage?

TED
It's good.

CHESTER
Fuckin' good, Ted. It's fuckin' good. 
Let's try it again, shall we? So, 
Ted, whadya think about the beverage.

TED
It's fuckin' good.

CHESTER
You bet your sweet bippy, Ted. It's 
fuckin' Cristal, everything else is 
piss.

Norman in the chair starts yelling at Ted.

NORMAN
Bellboy! Bellboy! Bellboy!

Ted knows he's being laughed at, but not why.

CHESTER
(to Norman)
Knock it off, you're making my friend 
Ted here uneasy.
(to Ted)
Pay no attention to Norman here, 
Ted, he's just fuckin' wit' ya, that's 
all. That's from Quadrophenia. Now 
me, myself, when I think of bellboys 
I think of -- "bellboy" isn't an 
insult, is it? Is there another name 
for what you do that I'm ignorant 
of? Bellman, bellperson --

TED
Bellboy's fine.

CHESTER
Good. I'm glad they haven't changed 
that. There's a friendliness to 
"bellboy." As I was saying, Ted, 
when Norman thinks of bellboys, he 
thinks of Quadrophenia.

But me, when I think of bellboys, I think of The Bellboy, 
with Jerry Lewis. Didja ever see The Bellboy?

TED
No.

CHESTER
You should, it's one of Jerry's better 
movies. He never says a word through 
the entire film. A completely silent 
performance. How many actors can 
pull that off? And he has to go to 
France to get respect. That says it 
all about America right there. The 
minute Jerry Lewis dies, every paper 
in this fuckin' country gonna write 
articles calling the man a genius. 
It's not right. It's not right and 
it's not fair. But why should that 
surprise anybody? When has America 
ever been fair? We might be right 
every once in a while, but we're 
very rarely fair.

TED
Where do you want this?

CHESTER
You in a hurry, Ted?

TED
(he is, but doesn't 
want to rush the 
movie star)
No, not particularly.

CHESTER
Good, then stop playing "Beat the 
Clock." Now let me introduce you to 
everybody.

He puts his arm around Ted and leads him around the room.

Angela crosses frame, drink in hand.

CHESTER
Our friend from downstairs you already 
seem to be acquainted with.

As she snuggles up in a big comfy chair:

ANGELA
Oh, me and Theodore go way back. 
Don't we, Theodore?

TED
The name's Ted, Angela. I only let 
people with loaded guns at my head 
call me Theodore.

CHESTER
Angela's like you, Ted, a newfound 
friend.

ANGELA
We met at the pool.

CHESTER
(to Ted)
Have you ever seen Angela in a one-
piece?

TED
No.

CHESTER
Well, it's somethin' to see.
(arm around Ted)
The Man sitting in the chair, with 
the bottle of Jim Bean in his hand 
and the sense of humor, is Norman. 
Norman, say hello to Ted.

NORMAN
What's up?

Norman shakes his hand.

CHESTER
The sociable son of a bitch on the 
telephone is Leo. And the person on 
the other end of the phone is his 
lovely wife Ellen.
(to Leo)
Leo, say hello to Ted.

Leo breaks away from his phone conversation for two seconds.

LEO
Hi, Ted, glad you could make it.
(back to phone)
What?
(pause)
What does punctuality have to do 
with love?

CHESTER
Which brings me to me, Chester Rush, 
Ted. Pleased to meetcha.

Chester shakes Ted's hand.

TED
I know. I'm sorry I haven't seen 
your movie.

Chester stops.

Ted wonders if he should have said that.

Chester walks over to the table and pours himself some more 
champagne. When he talks now it's slower and somewhat 
distracted. The tone of the scene starts changing.

CHESTER
It's quite all right, Ted, nothing 
to feel sorry about. That's why God 
invented video. But you know, Ted, a 
lot of people did see it.

Chester takes a drink of champagne, a disgusted look crosses 
his face, and he slowly puts it down.

His manner gives the room a chill.

When he talks, he addresses the room.

CHESTER
Who drank out of this bottle last?

No answer.

Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass.

CHESTER
Who drank out of this bottle -- not 
the other bottles -- this bottle 
last?

NORMAN
What's wrong, Chester?

He spills the champagne from his glass onto the floor.

CHESTER
It's fuckin' flat, Norman, that's 
what's wrong. The champagne -- the 
fuckin' Cristal's fuckin' flat.

Chester improvises a temper tantrum about the flat Cristal. 
Everyone looks at him, not knowing what to say. Even Leo 
walks over to witness. The whole room is uneasy and a little 
frightened.

When Chester finishes his tantrum, he turns his attention 
back to Ted. As he talks to him, he opens up another bottle. 
But it's not the rapid-pace delivery Chester has done so 
far. It's more troubled and distracted.

CHESTER
I was saying, Ted, a lot of people 
did see it. And not just on video, 
either. Leo, what was the final take 
on domestic?

Leo is still in the doorway making sure his boy's cool.

LEO
72.1 million.
(worried tone)
You okay, champ?

CHESTER
(struggling with bottle)
I'm cool, so talk to your wife.

Leo turns his attention back to the phone and goes inside 
the room.

CHESTER
(to Ted)
72.1 million dollars. That's before 
video and before foreign, and before 
pay-TV and before free TV. We're 
talking fuckin' asses in fuckin' 
seats.
(he pops the cork)
Before all that other shit, The Wacky 
Detective made 72.1 million dollars.

Chester walks over to Ted and fills his glass.

CHESTER
And my new one, The Dog Catcher, 
it's projected to break a hundred.
(he clinks Ted's glass 
with his)
The Dog Catcher.

TED
The Dog Catcher.

They both drink.

The tantrum's over, and Chester's back to his fast-talking, 
good-natured self.

CHESTER
Now let's stroll over here and see 
what goodies you brought us.

TED
Do you mind me asking what's all 
this stuff for?

CHESTER
One thing at a time, Ted. I'm not a 
frog and you're not a bunny, so let's 
not jump ahead. C'mon, Norman, you 
should be interested in this.

NORMAN
Damn Skippy!
(pause)
Tell it.

Ted produces the things they called for.

TED
A block of wood.

Chester knocks on it.

CHESTER
Good.

TED
Three nails.

NORMAN
Why three nails?

CHESTER
That's how many Peter Lorre asked 
for. Continue, Ted.

Ted is completely bewildered.

TED
A roll of twine.

CHESTER
That's definitely a roll of twine. 
Continue.

TED
A bucket of ice.

CHESTER
(to Norman)
You into it?

NORMAN
(to Chester)
I'm into it.

CHESTER
(to Ted)
Go on.

TED
A donut.

Chester takes it and eats it.

CHESTER
That's for me. Continue.

TED
And a hatchet.

CHESTER
A hatchet as sharp as the devil 
himself is what I asked for.

TED
Well, you be the judge.

Ted holds the hatchet out for Chester to take. Norman snatches 
it instead.

NORMAN
I'll be the judge.

Norman touches the end of the blade with his thumb.

CHESTER
Whadya think?

NORMAN
That's a sharp motherfucker. Bring 
all this bullshit over to the bar.

CHESTER
You heard him, Ted.

Ted is completely confused and starting to get a little 
scared, but he does what he's told.

Leo slams down the phone.

LEO
Bitch!

NORMAN
You still married?

LEO
Maybe, maybe not, but I don't give a 
flyin' fuck either way. I've had it 
with that Machiavellian bitch! I'm 
too drunk to drive home. I'm sorry 
about that, I'm real sorry about 
that. I got drunk on New Year's Eve, 
cut my fuckin' head off...
(noticing Ted at the 
bar)
What's going on here?

CHESTER
We now return you to The Man from 
Rio, already in progress.

LEO
(surprised)
Noooo, you're gonna do it?

NORMAN
Looks like.

LEO
You guys ain't bullshittin', you're 
gonna really go for it?

Angela is still curled up.

ANGELA
After talkin' about it all night, 
they better. I wanna see a show.

CHESTER
When we do it, you'll have something 
to see.

Leo walks up to Norman and throws his arm around him.

LEO
You are one radical dude.

Ted doesn't know what anybody's talking about, which is just 
fine with him. He finishes laying out everything on the bar 
and says:

TED
Well, that's everything, so if you 
don't need me for anything else, 
I'll go back downstairs.

CHESTER
Not so fast, Ted. We ain't quite 
done yet. Why don't you take a seat 
at the bar, get comfortable, and 
have an open mind when we explain 
the festivities of the evening to 
you.

TED
Look, guys, you paid for the room. 
As long as you don't break up the 
furniture, you can do whatever the 
fuck you want. And me personally, I 
don't care if you break up the 
furniture. You don't have to explain 
anything to me. Whatever constitutes 
a good time as far as you guys are 
concerned is your business.

CHESTER
Well, it's your business, Ted. 'Cause 
we want you to take part.

TED
Take part in what?

LEO
Chester, your way of breaking the 
news to him gently is scarin' the 
shit outta him.

ANGELA
Look at the poor guy. Just spit it 
out.

Little by little everybody has gathered around Ted.

CHESTER
First off, let me say that there's 
nothing homosexual about what we're 
going to ask you to do. There's 
nothing sexual at all about what we 
want. But I was thinkin' you might 
be thinkin' we want you to do some 
sex thing. Pee on us, suck us off, 
shit like that. Let me assure you 
nothing could be farther from what 
we want --

Angela interrupts:

ANGELA
Can I jump in here?

CHESTER
No, you can't jump in here, this is 
my story.

ANGELA
Theodore's been here fifteen minutes 
and you've talked about everything 
but.

CHESTER
Hey, if you don't like it, you can 
get the fuck out.

Leo taps his champagne glass with a tiny spoon, shutting 
everybody up.

LEO
If it'll please the court, let me 
explain to Ted our intentions.

NORMAN
(yelling)
I second the nomination!

CHESTER
(yelling)
Move the nomination be closed!

Chester takes the hatchet and brings it down on the bar like 
a hatchet.

CHESTER
(calmly)
Leo, the floor is yours.

LEO
Thank you.
(to Ted)
Ted, did you ever watch the old 
"Alfred Hitchcock Show"?

TED
(totally bewildered 
at this point)
Yeah.

LEO
Did you ever see the episode The Man 
from Rio, with Peter Lorre and Steve 
McQueen?

TED
I don't think so.

LEO
Oh, you'd remember it all right. In 
the show, Peter Lorre makes a bet 
that Steve McQueen can't light his 
cigarette lighter ten times in a 
row. Now if Steve McQueen can light 
his cigarette lighter ten times in a 
row, he wins Peter Lorre's new car. 
If he can't he loses his little 
finger.
(pause)
Norman and Chester just made the 
same bet.
(pause)
Norman's putting up his pinky against 
Chester's mint convertible, 1964 red 
convertible Chevy Corvelle that he 
can light his Zippo ten times in a 
row.

Pause.

Ted looks at all of them, taking in the information, before 
saying:

TED
You guys are drunk.

CHESTER
Well, that goes without saying, but 
that doesn't mean we don't know what 
we're doing.

NORMAN
I'll tell ya what I'm doin'.

Norman lays an issue of Hot Classic Cars in front of Ted on 
the bar. On the cover is a picture of Chester smiling, 
standing next to a beautiful 1964 red convertible Chevy 
Corvelle. The headline reads: "Hollywood's Hottest New Star 
Next to America's Hottest Old Car."

NORMAN
I drive a motherfuckin' Honda my 
sister sold me. You hear what I'm 
sayin'? A little white motherfuckin' 
Honda Civic.
(he holds up the 
magazine)
You see this shit?!
(reading the magazine)
"Hollywood's hottest new star, next 
to America's hottest old car."
(he hands Ted the 
magazine)
Now you take a good look at that 
machine that this motherfucker over 
here is standing next to. That's a 
1964 nigger-red, rag-top Chevy 
Corvelle. And I love that car more'n 
I love hips, lips, and fingertips. 
Cut to we sittin' here celebrating, 
gettin' high, drinkin' champagne --

CHESTER
-- Cristal. When you're drinkin' 
anything else, you're drinking 
champagne. When you're drinkin' 
Cristal, you say you're drinkin' 
Cristal.

NORMAN
-- drinkin' Cristal. Watchin' TV. 
"Rockin' New Year's Eve." When all 
of a sudden we flip on Steve McQueen 
and Peter Lorre bein' fuckin' badass. 
And I look at this funny motherfucker 
over here, and I say, "I'd do that 
for the Chevelle."

LEO
And Chester replies...

CHESTER
"...Oh, really?"

TED
You guys wouldn't be doin' something 
this stupid unless you were drunk.

Everybody breaks into a "here, here" murmur.

NORMAN
I think that pretty much goes without 
sayin'. We'd probably chicken out. 
But when you're fucked-up, you don't 
lie. You tell the fuckin' truth. And 
the fuckin' truth is, my lucky Zippo's 
gonna win me Chester's car.

TED
(to Chester)
Why are you doing this?

CHESTER
Thrill of the bet. I'm the one with 
something to lose here. 'Cause I can 
pretty near guarantee that I love my 
car more'n Norman loves his pinky.

TED
(to Leo)
How 'bout you guys, you're just gonna 
sit back and let your friends mutilate 
each other?

LEO
Why not? Life don't get much more 
exciting than this. I mean if Norman 
was puttin' his dick on the choppin' 
block, I'd step in, 'cause, ya know 
in the morning, we'd really regret 
that. But his pinky? Who gives a 
fuck? I mean theoretically, he could 
lose that choppin' onions tomorrow. 
Life still goes on.

TED
(to Angela)
How 'bout you?

ANGELA
(to Ted)
I don't care.

CHESTER
Which brings us to your part in this 
little wager.

TED
I don't have a part.

CHESTER
Now, Ted, my old granddaddy used ta 
say: "The less a man makes declarative 
statements, the less he's apt to 
look foolish in retrospect." Now 
there're some inherent obstacles in 
this undertaking. First of all, I'm 
not some sick fuck like Peter Lorre 
on that show, travelin' the 
countryside collecting fingers. We're 
all buddies, here. Nobody wants Norman 
to lose his finger. We just wanna 
chop it off. So if fate doesn't smile 
on ol' Norman, we'll put his finger 
on ice and rush 'im to a hospital, 
where in all likelihood be able to 
sew it back on.

TED
Hopefully.

LEO
Eighty percent.

NORMAN
Our side.

CHESTER
So Norman's protected. His interests 
have been looked after. My interests, 
on the other hand, have not. I am as 
emotionally attached to my car as 
Norman is physically to his finger. 
I'm putting up a very expensive piece 
of machinery on this wager. Now, if 
I lose, I lose, I have no problem 
with that. I'm a big boy, I knew 
what I was doing. However, if I win, 
I wanna win. If Norman lights his 
lighter ten times in a row, he's 
gonna have no emotional problems 
about taking my car keys whatsoever. 
But if I win, it's not inconceivable 
that Leo or myself, at the last 
minute, might not be able to wield 
the ax. Which brings us full circle 
to you, Ted. Sober Ted. Clear-eyed 
Ted. We want you to be the diceman.

Pause as they all look at him. Angela breaks it.

ANGELA
Helluva night, huh, Ted?

TED
I gotta get out of here.

Ted abruptly gets up and makes a beeline for the door.

Chester whips out a hundred-dollar bill and quickly calls to 
Ted from his position at the bar.

CHESTER
Ted, I got a hundred-dollar bill 
here with your name on it, whether 
you do what we ask or not, just to 
sit back down in the chair for one 
minute more.

Ted spins in his direction.

TED
I'm not gonna cut off his finger!

CHESTER
Maybe you will and maybe you won't, 
but that has nothing to do with this 
hundred-dollar bill in my hand. You 
can tell us all to go fuck off and 
walk right out that door. But if you 
sit back down and wait sixty seconds 
before you do it, you'll be a hundred 
dollars richer.

Ted just stands across the room, thinking.

ANGELA
Ted. Take the money.

LEO
Ted, you're gonna do whatever you 
want to do. We're just askin' you to 
indulge us for another minute more. 
And Chester's willin' to pay for it.

Ted thinks.

TED
I'll take your money, and I'll sit 
back down. But a minute from now, 
I'm gonna walk out the door, and 
when I do, there'll be no hard 
feelings?

CHESTER
Well, I want you to have a bit more 
of an open mind than that, but, yeah, 
we'll either convince you or we won't. 
No hard feelings. Right, guys?

Everybody agrees.

Ted wearily sits back down.

Chester positions himself in front of Ted at the bar.

CHESTER
Okay, Leo, you be the timekeeper. 
Let us know when one minute begins 
and when it ends.

LEO
You got it.
(he checks his watch)
Gentlemen, start your engines.

Chester jumps up and down, loosening up.

LEO
Begin!

Chester, who talks fast anyway, starts his pitch. It's Chester 
who now plays "Beat the Clock."

CHESTER
Okay, pay attention here, Ted, I 
ain't got much time. Now I'm gonna 
make two piles here on the bar.
(he takes the hundred-
dollar bill and lays 
it out on the bar)
One pile,
(pointing at the 
hundred-dollar bill)
which is yours. And another pile,
(Chester whips out a 
money roll fat enough 
to choke a horse to 
death)
which could be yours.
(he lays a matching 
hundred-dollar bill 
on the bar, starting 
a second pile)
Now, what you have to be aware of is 
we're gonna do this bet, one way,
(he lays another 
hundred on the end 
pile)
or the other.
(he lays another 
hundred on the pile)
Whether it's you who holds the ax,
(he lays another 
hundred on the pile)
or the desk clerk downstairs,
(he lays another 
hundred on the pile)
or some bum we yank off the street.
(he lays another 
hundred on the pile)

NORMAN
You can buy a lot of soup with that 
pile.

CHESTER
(to Norman)
Shhhh, I'm the closer.
(to the group)
How much is on the bar already? I 
lost count.

ANGELA
Six hundred.

CHESTER
Six hundred. Ted, do you know how 
long it takes the average American 
to count to six hundred?

TED
No.

CHESTER
(laying another bill 
on the pile)
One minute less than it takes to 
count to seven hundred. You know, 
Ted, a person's life is made up of a 
zillion little experiences.
(he lays another bill 
on the pile)
Some, which have no meaning, are 
insignificant and you forget them. 
And some that stick with you for the 
rest of your natural life --
(he lays another bill 
on the pile)
-- barring Alzheimer's of course. 
Now, what we're proposing is so 
unusual, so outside the norm, that I 
think it would be a pretty good guess 
that this will be one of those 
experiences that sticks. So, since 
you're gonna be stuck remembering 
this moment for the rest of your 
life, you gotta decide what that 
memory will be.
(He lays down the 
last bill on the 
pile)
So, are you gonna remember for the 
next forty years, give or take a 
decade, how you refused a thousand 
dollars for one second's worth of 
work, or how you made a thousand 
dollars for one second's worth of 
work?

LEO
Time!

CHESTER
Well, Ted, what's it gonna be?

Ted looks at the pile, then looks up. We dolly into his face.

FLASHBACK

We see a quick MONTAGE of horrendous moments from all the 
other stories.

INT. PENTHOUSE--NIGHT

Back to Ted.

TED
Okay.

The group cheers.

TED
But when it's over, no matter what 
happens, I get the money?

CHESTER
As long as you do your part, you can 
take the pile, walk out the door, 
and not say another word.

TED
Let's do it right now, before I change 
my mind.

NORMAN
Here, here.

Everybody gets in their position by the bar. Norman lays his 
left hand on the block of wood with his pinky sticking out.

In his right hand is his Zippo lighter, poised and ready to 
strike.

Chester hands Ted the meat cleaver.

Ted takes it, raises it up above Norman's finger, in position.

CHESTER
Perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect! 
This is great! This is a moment in 
time none of us will ever forget.

Everybody is crowded around the scene, on pins and needles.

CHESTER
Norman, you ready?

NORMAN
Ready!

CHESTER
Ted, you ready?

TED
Ready.

CHESTER
Okeydoke. Norman, begin.

Norman looks hard at the Zippo in his hand. Ted, holding the 
cleaver, stares focused on Norman's pinky.

Norman readies himself.

Places his thumb on the wheel in the Zippo.

Takes a breath.

And strikes.

It sparks, but doesn't light.

Without missing a beat, Ted brings down the cleaver, slicing 
off Norman's pinky.

Norman lets out a scream.

Ted, in one move, lays down the cleaver, scoops up the money 
and walks out the door.

INT. HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN

CAMERA is positioned at far end of hallway, looking down it 
at the elevator at the other end.

Ted walks out of the penthouse in the f.g. In a MEDIUM SHOT, 
he takes the thousand dollars in his hand, looks at it, 
smiles, and sticks it in his pocket. It might've been a bad 
night, but it's been a profitable one. He chuckles at the 
irony, and, whistling a happy tune, turns his back on the 
camera and walks down the hall to the elevator.

All the while we hear PANDEMONIUM breaking out behind the 
door.

As Ted walks to the elevator, the CREDITS ROLL. He waits for 
the elevator, it arrives, he gets in, the doors close.

As CREDITS CONTINUE TO ROLL, we hold for about two beats... 
then...

The door BURSTS open and everybody comes piling out. 
Everybody's screaming, yelling different things to one 
another. Norman has a bloody towel wrapped around his hand, 
he's screaming and crying.

NORMAN
My finger, my fucking finger!!

Chester has the bucket of ice with the finger in it. Leo's 
trying to direct everything. Everybody's in frantic activity, 
except for Angela, who stands back, drinks her drink, and 
watches the show. They all run down the hall, toward the 
elevator. Somebody trips and they all hit the ground. The 
bucket of ice with the finger goes spilling. They run around 
like crazy, looking for the finger and picking up ice cubes. 
Norman lies on the floor and screams. They pick it all up, 
get to the elevator, and push the button.

When it arrives, they all dive in except for Angela.

ANGELA
You know, I'm gonna call it a night 
and go back to my room. It's been 
fun.

The doors close on the screaming maniacs.

Angela walks through a door marked "Stairway."

INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY--AFTER DAWN

MEDIUM STAIRWAY DOOR

CREDIT ROLL continues Angela comes through the door; we 
STEADICAM in front of her as she walks the halls, looking 
for her room. She finds it...

WE STOP CREDITS

FOUR ROOMS

Angela sticks her key in the door, then stops when she sees 
something approaching. The look on her face combines strange 
awe and mild shock.

Almost floating ethereally, a mysterious Blond Bombshell, 
wearing Diana's see-through negligee and slippers, armed 
with Elspeth's sword slung over her shoulder, wanders toward 
her. She is in a daze, perhaps lost or drunk.

ANGELA
You okay, lady?

The bombshell looks up at her dizzily.

ANGELA
I said -- you looking for someone?

DIANA
(disoriented)
Uhhh... yes... my husband... I think. 
Have you seen him?

Angela and the girl have a strange moment as they connect 
through the eyes.

Having had enough emotional intensity tonight, Angela breaks 
their eye contact.

ANGELA
Lady, I haven't seen anybody.

Diana quietly says, "Ohhh," as she drifts on down the hall 
in a daze. Angela puts her hand to her temples before opening 
her hotel door. She does a double-take on the hallway -- 
empty.

She pauses a beat, then walks into her room. After the door 
closes, we hear Sigfried on the other side.

SIGFRIED
Where the hell have you been?

CREDITS CONTINUE TO ROLL

THE END
FADE IN:
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
surround it.

CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
WORLD OF LIQUOR.

TITLE CARD:

BIG SPRING, TEXAS
109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
off duty for the day.

The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth

INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
stool behind the counter.

A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
bare feet. They look through magazines.

Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
seventeen.

MCGRAW enters the store.

MCGRAW
Hot goddamn day!

PETE
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
the air conditioner blastin' all day
long.

MCGRAW
Not even for lunch?

PETE
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
outta the microwave.

McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
joins Pete by the front counter.

MCGRAW
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
Those burritos are only fit for a
hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
tanked tonight.

PETE
Whatsamatter?

MCGRAW
(sighs)
Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
Every inch of it hot and miserable.
First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
boy of hers was workin' the grill.
That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
blanket like a sick dog by ten
thirty.

PETE
Isn't there a law or something
against retards serving food to the
public?

MCGRAW
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
be. Who knows what goes on inside 
Mongoloid's mind?

PETE
You could sue the shit out of her, ya
know. That kid belongs under a circus
tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
own that fuckin' place.

MCGRAW
What the hell would I do with that
grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
enough of a cross to bear just taking
care of that potato head. Then all
this Abilene shit happened. You
heard about that bank robbery in
Abilene, didn't ya?

PETE
That's all that's been on the box
all day. They killed some people
didn't they?

MCGRAW
Four Rangers, three cops, and two
civilians. And they took a lady bank
teller as a hostage.

Pete doesn't say anything.

MCGRAW
They'll probably make a run for the
border, which would bring 'em this
way. And if we get our hands on
those shit asses, we're talking
payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
commode.

PETE
Knock yourself out.

McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
exits in the bathroom.

The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
We see that the girl is crying.

BLACK SUITED MAN #1
(to Pete)
Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
you, asshole?
(points to the tearful prep
school girl)
Do you want this little girl to die?
(pointing to the blonde with
the other guy)
Or that little girl? Or your
bosombuddy with the badge? Or
yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
Wild Bunch if I even think you're
fuckin' with me.

The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
the blonde.

Everybody speaks low and fast.

PETE
What do you want from me? I did what
you said.

SETH
Letting him use your toilet? No store
does that.

PETE
He comes in here every day and we
bullshit. He's used my toilet a
thousand times. If I told him no,
he'd know something was up.

SETH
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
here, in his car, and down the road or
you can change the name of this
place to "Benny's World of Blood."

Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
at Pete.

SETH
Were you giving that pig signals?

PETE
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
anything!

Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

SETH
He says you were scratching.

PETE
I wasn't scratching!

SETH
You callin' him a liar?

Pete controls himself.

PETE
I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
simply saying that if I was
scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
not because I was signaling the cop,
it's because I'm fuckin' scared
shitless.

Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
Seth.

RICHARD
The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
I just go in there, blow his head off
and get outta here.

PETE
Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
act natural, and I'm acting as natural
-- in fact, under the circumstances, I
think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
Award for how natural I'm acting. You
asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
my best.

SETH
Yeah, well, your best better get a
helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
worse.

The toilet FLUSHES.

SETH
Everybody be cool.

Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
of the situation.

MCGRAW
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
in front of the box and just drink
booze. How much is the bottle?

PETE
Six-fifty.

Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

McGraw goes down screaming.

Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

Seth charges forward.

SETH
(to Richard)
What the fuck was that about?

RICHARD
(in a low monotone)
He signaled the Ranger.

PETE
(hysterical)
I didn't.
(to Seth)
You gotta believe me, I didn't.

RICHARD
(to Seth)
When they were talkin', he mouthed
the words "Help Us."

PETE
You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

SETH
What the fuck is wrong with you --

RICHARD
Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
cooler with your back turned. I was by
the magazines, I could see his face.
And I saw him mouth:

Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
out a gun from it.

Seth releases his brother.

SETH
Start the car.

RICHARD
You believe me don't cha?

SETH
Shut up and start the car.

Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
the hand.

Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

The two girls have run out screaming.

SETH
(yelling)
Richie? You okay?

RICHARD
(yelling)
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
I told you that bastard said, "Help
us!"

PETE
(yelling)
I never said help us!

SETH
(yelling)
Well that don't matter now, 'cause
you got about two fuckin' seconds
to live! Richie!

RICHARD
(yelling)
Yeah?

SETH
(yelling)
When I count three, shoot out the
bottles behind him!

RICHARD
Gotcha!

SETH
One... Two... Three.

The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
RAIN down on him.

Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

Richard keeps FIRING.

Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

The fireball lands behind the counter.

The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
screams from behind the counter.

Seth smiles to himself and stands.

Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
still holding his weapon and FIRING.

Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
Pastry display.

Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.

EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
flames.

SETH
What did I tell you? What did I tell
you? Buy the road map and leave.

RICHARD
What am I supposed to do, Seth?
He recognized us.

SETH
He didn't recognize shit.

Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

RICHARD
Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
looked at us -- you especially --
I knew he knew.

They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
hear Seth mumbling under the motor.

SETH
Low profile. Do you know what the
words "low profile" mean?

CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.

The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
the street, and speeds off down the road.

We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
behind it, as the store burns out of control.

OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.

Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.

EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY

The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:

AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.

The rest of the titles play over black as the song
continues.

EXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

Emma and Pete's Gravy Train is a truck stop off of Highway
290.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN':

FORT STOCKTON
238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER

INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

JACOB
We got about two more hours of day
light left. That'll get us into
El Paso, which is right next to the
border. We'll stop at a motel --

SCOTT
Stop? We're not going to actually
stop at a motel, are we?

Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

SCOTT AND KATE
We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
those over priced roach havens. We're
self contained.

JACOB
Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
overzealous, but give me a break, I
just bought it.

Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

SCOTT
Why, just look at all this. You got
your kitchen --

KATE
-- you got your microwave --

SCOTT
-- you got your sink --

KATE
-- you got your shower --

SCOTT
-- see this, television!

KATE
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

JACOB
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
what say we drop this?

SCOTT
(to Kate)
The truth hurts.

KATE
(to Scott)
It's the bitterest of pills.

JACOB
You two ought to start a stand-up
act, because you're just wasting your
humor on me.

KATE
Ain't it the truth.

SCOTT
Why do you want to stop?

JACOB
I'm exhausted.

SCOTT
Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
into Mexico.

Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
new motor home."

JACOB
I just bet you would. Don't even thin
about it. Besides, I want to have one
night's sleep in an
honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
the home are okay, but they're not
like a real bed.

KATE
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
swim.

SCOTT
I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
the bathroom.

Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
restroom.

Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
silence before...

KATE
Dad, when I called the machine to
check our messages there was one from
Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
wouldn't permanently replace you until
we came back. He said when we come
home, if you still feel the same
way --

JACOB
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
call him tomorrow and tell him not
to bother waiting.

KATE
I didn't want to talk about this in
front of Scott because he gets upset.
But you don't believe in God
anymore?

JACOB
Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
know this is hard on you kids. After
Jenny's death, this is probably the
last thing you need. But I can't do
it any longer. My congregation needs
spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
get that from me anymore. My faith is
gone. To answer your question, yes,
I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
them? No. After Jenny died, I just
thought, what's the point?

KATE
(pushing him)
It's just, all our lives you've been
a pastor. For twenty years you've
preached trust in the lord. And then
one day you wake up and say fuck him?

JACOB
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
connected anymore.

KATE
That happens, you'll get it back.

JACOB
Kate, give your old man a little
credit. Every person who chooses the
service of God as their life's work
has something in common. I don't care
if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
many times during your life you'll
look at your reflection in the mirror
and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
all done it. I'm not going through a
lapse. What I've experienced is closer
to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
your faith. I've just decided not to
devote my life to God anymore.

KATE
What do you think Mom would say?

JACOB
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

Nobody responds to the bell. Seth BANGS it impatiently five
times.

TEXAS VOICE (O.S.)
Hold your horses!

An OLD-TIMER walks through a curtain behind the counter.
He's eating a BBQ rib.

OLD-TIMER

Whatcha want?

SETH
Whatcha think I want, ya mean old
bastard? I wanna room.

EXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY

Richard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the
radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the
walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up,
and drives them to their room.

RICHARD
Do they have cable?

SETH
No.

RICHARD
Do they have an X-rated channel?

SETH
No.

RICHARD
Do they have a waterbed?

SETH
They don't have anything except four
walls and a roof, and that's all we
need.

Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
trunk close to the door.

The two brothers get out of the car.

SETH
(tossing Richie the motel keys)
Open the door. We gotta do this fast.

Richie opens the door.

Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
empty.

CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.

TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.

SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
up in the trunk.

She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
scared and looks an absolute mess.

SETH
Don't say a word.

The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
see any, slams the door.

INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY

Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.

SETH
You. Plant yourself in that chair.

She sits down in the chair.

HOSTAGE
What are you planning on doing with --

SETH
-- I said plant yourself. Plants don't
talk. You wanna get on my good side?
Just sit still and don't make a peep.

She shuts up.

Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
wound.

SETH
Let me help you.

He helps him get his jacket off.

SETH
How's it feel?

RICHARD
How ya think, it hurts like a
son-of-a-bitch.

Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
against.

SETH
I got both rooms on either side of us,
so we don't gotta worry about
eavesdropping assholes. How's that
feel? You okay?

RICHARD
Feels good.

SETH
I'm gonna go get the money.

He heads for the door.

EXT. COURTYARD - MOTEL - DAY

Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans
the perimeter with his eyes, goes back inside.

INT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY

Seth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has
the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping
stations. Seth looks at his watch.

SETH
It's about five o'clock.
(to hostage)
What time does it get dark around
here?

HOSTAGE
About seven.

SETH
Good. I'm going towards the border to
check things out while it's still
daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the
rendezvous.

RICHARD
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
can arrange a better deal than thirty
percent.

SETH
That's their standard deal, brother.
They ain't about to change it for us.

RICHARD
Did you even to try to negotiate?

SETH
These guys ain't spic fire cracker
salesman from Tijuana. They don't even
know the meaning of the word "barter".
You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
them thirty percent of your loot. It's
scripture. So it is written, so shall
it be done. You want sanctuary, you
pay the price, and the price is thirty
percent.

RICHARD
All I'm saying --

SETH
-- This conversation is over.

Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

SETH
Now, we need to have a talk. What's
your name?

HOSTAGE
Gloria.

He shakes her hand.

SETH
Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
brother Richie. Let's cut to the
chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
and all I want is a yes or no answer.
Do you want to live through this?

GLORIA
Yes.

SETH
Good. Then let me explain the house
rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
along like a house on fire. Rule number
one: No noise, no question. You make a
noise...
(he holds up his .45)
...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
you absolutely, positively clear about
rule number one?

GLORIA
Yes.

SETH
Rule number two: You do what we say,
when we say it. If you don't, see rule
number one.

Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
hammer.

SETH
Rule number three: Don't you ever try
and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
five little friends, and they all run
faster 'n you can. Got it?

She nods her head yes.

He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

SETH
Open your eyes.

She does.

SETH
Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
get out of this alive. I give you my
word. Okay?

She nods her head yes.

Seth rises.

SETH
I'll be back in a bit.

He exits.

Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
across the room in the chair.

RICHARD
Wanna come up here on the bed and
watch TV with me?

You can tell she doesn't want to.

He pats the empty space next to him.

RICHARD
Come on.

She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
next to him.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the
middle of a conversation with the party on the other end.

SETH
Things are real hot here. Crossing's
gonna be a bitch.
(pause)
Don't worry, we'll get across. But
when we do, where do we go?
(pause)
Can we make it as close to the border
as possible? Texas wants our balls.
The quicker we're in your protection,
the better I'll feel.
(pause)
Okay, where?
(pause)
The Titty Twister?
(he laughs)
I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll
see you and your men at the "Titty

A local newscaster named KELLY HOUGE is reporting a story
about the brothers.

KELLY HOUGE
(talking to camera)
This bloody crime spree started just a
week ago today. The oldest of the two
brothers...

MUG SHOT OF SETH

KELLY HOUGE (V.O)
...Seth Gecko was serving time in
Rolling's Kansas State Penitentiary
for his part in the 1988 Scott City
bank robbery in which two law
enforcement officers lost their lives.

BACK TO KELLY

KELLY HOUGE
Having served eight years of his
twenty-two year sentence, Seth Gecko
was brought to Wichita Municipal court
house for his first parole hearing. It
was while at the court house that this
man...

MUG SHOT OF RICHARD GECKO

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)
... his younger brother Richard Gecko,
a known armed robber and sex offender,
pulled off a daring daylight escape...

BACK TO KELLY

KELLY HOUGE
...resulting in the death of four
Wichita law enforcement officers, and
this woman...

The red line enters Texas and the camera moves into Texas.

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

then finally...

WE ZOOM in on a red-circled Abilene.

KELLY HOUGE (V.O.)

We hear GUNFIRE and SCREAMS.

KELLY HOUGE
Heading the case to bring these
fugitives to justice is FBI agent
Stanley Chase. We talked with agent
Chase earlier this afternoon.

CUT TO:

VIDEO INTERVIEW

Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.

STANLEY CHASE
For the time being we are very
confident we will apprehend the
fugitives in the next forty-eight
hours. The Bureau, local law
enforcement and the Texas Rangers
have all joined forces in forming a
dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
Gecko.

KELLY HOUGE
Agent Chase, does it appear that they
are heading for Mexico.

STANLEY CHASE
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
alerted the Mexican authorities. They
intend to cooperate every way possible
in bringing these fugitives to
justice.

KELLY HOUGE
Are you optimistic about the safety of
the hostage they took in Abilene,
Gloria Hill?

STANLEY CHASE
We've received no news one way or the
other. We can only hope for the best.

KELLY HOUGE
What about the report from an
eyewitness at the liquor store who
said one of the brothers was shot?

STANLEY CHASE
This can't be confirmed at this time,
but we do believe it to be true. We
have reason to believe it was the
youngest brother Richard, and he was
shot in the vicinity of his neck and
shoulders by the store's clerk.

KELLY HOUGE
Is it safe to assume that because the
death count involved and the loss of
life of law enforcement officers, that
the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
force are taking this manhunt
personally?

STANLEY CHASE
I would say that's a very safe
assumption.

CUT TO:

RICHARD SMILES.

RICHARD
(Newscaster's voice)
Is it safe to assume since the law
enforcement authorities in the great
state of Texas are homosexuals of a
sick and deviate nature, that they
will be too busy fucking each other
up the ass to actually catch The
Gecko Brothers?
(in an FBI voice)
I would say that's a very safe
assumption.

He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the
Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.

CASPER
Would you play with me?

A big burly COP turns around.

COP
Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!

The cop heads for the hills. Casper cries.

Seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two
take-out bags of Big Kahuna burgers.

RICHARD
Shit, I started to get worried. Where
the fuck ya been?

SETH
Sight seein'.

RICHARD
What'd ya see?

SETH
Cops.

RICHARD
Didya look at the border?

Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off
the TV

SETH
Yeah, I saw the border. Through
binoculars from on top of a high
building. That's about as close as I
risked getting. What's the TV say?

RICHARD
They're going to apprehend us in
forty-eight hours.

Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

SETH
(to himself)
I gotta figure a way to get across
that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
around El Paso our lives ain't worth
a shit.

RICHARD
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
in and wait for things to cool down.

SETH
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
worse before it gets any fuckin'
better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
find us, and when they find us,
they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
very personal when ya kill their law
enforcement officers. The El Paso
police have already started a motel
and hotel search for us.

RICHARD
How do you know?

SETH
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
rendezvous on the other side, then
Carlos and his boys will escort us to
El Ray and --

Seth stops talking and looks around.

SETH
Where's the woman?

RICHARD
What?

Seth's out of his chair.

SETH
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
is she, Richard!?

RICHARD
She's in the other room.

SETH
What the fuck is she doin' there?!

He goes to the door of the adjoining room.

RICHARD
Seth, before you open the door, let
me explain what happened.

Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
Then he BURSTS open the door.

The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
room with the dead body.

SETH
(to himself)
Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

Richard rises from the bed.

RICHARD
Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
just explain what happened.

Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

Richard backs up.

SETH
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
explanation. What's the matter with
you?

RICHARD
(low and calm)
There's nothing wrong with me,
brother. That woman tried to escape
and I did what I had to do.

SETH
No.
(pause)
That woman wouldn't of said shit if
she had a mouthful.

RICHARD
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
became a whole different person.

SETH
(slowly approaching)
Is it me? Is it my fault?

RICHARD
It's not your fault, it's her fault!

Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
holding tightly to his wrist.

SETH
Is this my fault? Do you think this
is what I am?

RICHARD
What?

SETH
This is not me! I am a professional
fucking thief. I steal money. You try
to stop me, god help you. But I don't
kill people I don't have to, and I
don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
how it's done. Do you understand?

RICHARD
Seth, if you were me --

SETH
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
yes.

RICHARD
Yes.

SETH
Yes, Seth, I understand.

RICHARD
Yes, Seth, I understand.

Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

SETH
(whispers in Richie's ear)
We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
and rice and beans. None of this
shit's gonna matter.

INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
the Old-Timer.

KATE
I can't believe he's stopping here.
This place looks totally cruddy.

Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
home.

KATE
Dad, why are we stopping here?

He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

JACOB
There's nothing wrong with this
place.

KATE
It's a flop house.

JACOB
It's not a flop house. It's basic
and simple. That doesn't make it a
flop house.

KATE
If it doesn't have a pool, we're
looking for a new place.

Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
courtyard.

JACOB
It has a bed. That's all I care about.

KATE
Other places have beds, they also have
cable TV, a gym, room service...

EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
thinking about how he's going to get over the border
tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
Fuller's motor home.

Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
THUD... THUD...

KATE
Owww, my head.

Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
window.

JACOB
Watch where you're going!

THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
up at the giant motor home.

JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

SCOTT
What's this guy's problem?

JACOB
I have no idea.

Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

HONK!

JACOB
Anytime, man.

The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
side to let them pass.

Pass they do!

KATE
Creepy guy.

SETH

The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
room #9.

INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
on the bed.

Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

JACOB
(yelling)
What?

From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

VOICE (O.S.)
I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

JACOB
I hope none of this is disturbing you.

Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
he smiles.

Jacob opens the door and sees...

... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
nicest guy in the entire world.

RICHARD
Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
lady friend need some ice and we don't
seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
right back.

JACOB
(still partially asleep)
Sure.

We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

JACOB
What is this?

Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

SETH
It's called a punch.

Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
mouth.

RICHARD
Sit down.

Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

RICHARD
Good boy.

Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

SETH
(to Jacob)
What's your name?

JACOB
Jacob.

SETH
Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
I'll shoot you in the face.

Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

SETH
(to Richard)
Okay, move the Jap over there.

Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

RICHARD
Upsy daisy.

...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

SETH
(to his hostages)
What's the story with you two? You a
couple of fags?

JACOB
He's my son.

SETH
How does that happen? You don't look
Japanese.

JACOB
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

SETH
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

JACOB
What's this about, money?

SETH
It's about money, all right, but not
yours. You see, me and my brother here
are in a little hot water and we need
your assistance.

The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
Kate walks in.

The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
ready to spit.

SETH
(to Scott and Jacob)
Stop!

Jacob and Scott freeze.

Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

KATE
What's going on?

RICHARD
We're having a wet bikini contest,
and you just won.

JACOB
(to Kate)
It's okay, honey. Everything's going
to be all right.

SETH
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
do nothin' stupid.
(he turns to Jacob and Scott,
who are still standing)
You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

They slowly sit.

Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
for their own reasons.

SETH
(to Jacob)
Where are the keys to the motor home?

JACOB
On the dresser.

SETH
Richie, take the keys. Start that big
bastard up, and drive it up front.

Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

He looks in her face.

CLOSE-UP KATE

She smiles at him.

KATE
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
my pussy?

CLOSE-UP RICHARD

RICHARD
Sure.

SETH (O.S.)
Richard!

Richard's eyes go to Seth.

Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

SETH
Not when you get around to it, now.

Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
room.

SETH
(pointing at Kate)
You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
put on some clothes.

She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
bathroom.

Seth GRABS her wrist.

SETH
You got three minutes. One second
longer, I shoot your father in the
face. Do you understand what I just
said?

KATE
Yes.

SETH
Do you believe me?

KATE
Yes.

SETH
You damn well better. Go.

She goes into the bathroom.

JACOB
Look, if you want the motor home, just
take it and get out.

Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
hostages.

SETH
Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
easy.

We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

SETH
Get ready to move out, we're all going
on a little ride.

Jacob shakes his head "no."

JACOB
Not a chance.

SETH
Come again?

JACOB
If you're taking people, take me. But
my kids aren't going anywhere with
you.

SETH
Sorry, I need everybody.

JACOB
My children are not going with you,
and that's that.

SETH
(angry)
That's not fuckin' that...
(holds up his gun)
this is fuckin' this.
(he calms down and looks
at Scott)
Go sit over there.

Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
conversational tone.

SETH
I ain't got time to fuck around with
you, so I'll make this simple. Take
your kids and get in the car, or I'll
execute all three of you right now.
(he cocks the gun and puts
it right in Jacob's face)
What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

Jacob looks at him.

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
Good.
(to Scott)
Your old man's all right, he just
saved your life.

Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

SETH
Times up, Princess.

The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

SETH
Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
the Lone Star night.

INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT

Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

KATE
Excuse me.

Richard zeros in on her.

RICHARD
What?

KATE
Where are you taking us?

RICHARD
Mexico.

KATE
What's in Mexico?

RICHARD
Mexicans.

He doesn't smile.

In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
calmly.

SETH
(reading his driver's license)
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
course it is.
(motioning behind him)
What are their names?

JACOB
Scott and Kate.

Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

SETH
Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

SETH
Who's this?

JACOB
My wife.

SETH
Where is the little lady?

JACOB
In heaven.

SETH
She's dead?

JACOB
Yes, she is.

SETH
How'd she die?

JACOB
Auto wreck.

SETH
Come on, gimme some more details.
How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
kill her?

JACOB
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
on the car weren't great. She had to
stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
she crashed, she died.

SETH
Died instantly?

JACOB
Not quite. She was trapped in the
wreck for about six hours before she
passed on.

SETH
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
it in and break it off, don't they?

JACOB
Yes, they do.

Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
license.

SETH
Is this real?

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
I've seen one of these before. A
friend of mine had himself declared
a minister of his own religion. Away
to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
doing, or are you the real McCoy?

JACOB
Real McCoy.

SETH
You're a preacher?

JACOB
I was a minister.

SETH
Was? As in not anymore?

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
Why'd ya quit?

JACOB
I think I've gotten about as up close
and personal with you as I'm gonna
get. Now if you need me like I think
you need me, you're not gonna kill me
'cause I won't answer your stupid,
prying questions. So, with all due
respect, mind your own business.

SETH
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
friendly. But you're right, enough
with the getting to know you shit.
Now, there's two ways we can play this
hand. One way is me and you go round
an' round all fuckin' night. The other
way, is we reach some sort of an
understanding. Now, if we go down that
first path at the end of the day, I'll
win. But we go down the second, we'll
both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
ass about you or your fuckin' family.
Y'all can live forever or die this
second and I don't care which. The
only things I do care about are me
that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
our money. And right now I need to get
those three things into Mexico. Now,
stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
you don't give a shit about seeing me
and my brother receiving justice, or
the bank getting its money back. Right
now all you care about is the safety
of your daughter, your son and
possibly yourself. Am I correct?

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
I thought so. You help us get across
the border without incident, stay with
us the rest of the night without
trying anything funny, and in the
morning we'll let you and your family
go. That way everybody gets what they
want. You and your kids get out of
this alive and we get into Mexico.
Everybody's happy.

JACOB
How do I know you'll keep your word?

SETH
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
this shit.

JACOB
You want me to sit here and be
passive. The only way being passive in
this situation makes sense is if I
believe you'll let us go. I'm not
there yet. You have to convince me
you're telling the truth.

SETH
Look, dickhead, the only thing you
need to be convinced about is that
you're stuck in a situation with a
coupla real mean motor scooters. I
don't wanna hafta worry about you all
fuckin' night. And I don't think you
wanna be worrying about my brother's
intentions toward your daughter all
night. You notice the way he looked
at her, didn't ya?

JACOB
Yes.

SETH
Didn't like it, did ya?

JACOB
No, I didn't.

SETH
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
I'm willing to make a deal. You
behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
try to escape. I'll keep my brother
off your daughter and let you all
loose in the morning.

JACOB
You won't let him touch her?

SETH
I can handle Richie, don't worry.

The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
Seth sticks out his hand.

SETH
I give you my word.

Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
word.

SETH
(hand sticks out)
My words, my law. Better you not take
it, and that's just where we are,
then take it and not mean it.

Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

JACOB
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
don't give a fuck how many guns you
have, nothing will stop me from
killing him.

SETH
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
kill all of you.
(calling to the back)
Kate, honey!

KATE
Yeah.

SETH
You must have a bible in here, don't
cha?

KATE
Yeah, we got a bible.

SETH
Get it and bring it up here, will
ya, please?

Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
front.

SETH
Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
(to Jacob)
Put your hand on it.

Jacob does.

SETH
Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
try to escape and you'll get us across
the border.

JACOB
I swear to God I won't try to escape
and I'll do my best to get you into
Mexico.

SETH
You best better get it done, Pops.

Seth places his hand on the Bible.

SETH
I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
I'll slit all your throats.

TIME CUT TO:

INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

expressionless, looks at Kate's bare feet.

Back to Richard.

RICHARD
Did ya mean what you said back there?

Kate turns to him.

KATE
What?

RICHARD
In the room. Were you serious, or were
you just foolin' around? I'm just
bringing it up, 'cause if you really
want me to do that for you, I will.

KATE
Do what?

RICHARD
(in a whisper)
What you said to me in the room.

KATE
(whispers back)
What did I say?

RICHARD
(whisper)
You asked me if I would --

SETH (O.S.)
Richard!

RICHARD
(to Seth)
What?

Seth and Jacob.

SETH
I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say
talk to 'em. You guys ain't got nothin' to say
to one another. So cut the chatter.

Richard turns to Kate.

RICHARD
(quiet)
We'll talk later.

Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
Fuller's mobile home.

INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
up and goes into action.

SETH
Okay everybody, it's show time.
Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

SETH
Scott, you come up front with your
daddy.

Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

JACOB
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

SETH
As long as you're cool, she'll be
cool. What're ya gonna say?

JACOB
I don't have the slightest idea.

SETH
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
gun next to Kate's temple.

Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
closing the door behind him.

Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
thing began.

SCOTT
What are you gonna do?

JACOB
I'm gonna try and get us across the
border.

SCOTT
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
they're back there.

Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.

INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
should open the door.

Everybody talks low and quiet.

RICHARD
This isn't gonna work.

SETH
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

RICHARD
I just want to go on record as saying
this is a bad idea.

SETH
Duly noted. Now, shut up.

Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

RICHARD
(to himself)
They're gonna search the van.

SETH
(offhand)
As long as you don't act like a
fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

RICHARD
What does that mean?

SETH
(distracted)
What?

Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

RICHARD
You just called me a fuckin' nut.

SETH
No, I didn't.

RICHARD
Yes, you did. You said as long as I
don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
that I've been acting like a fuckin'
nut.

SETH
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
cool.

RICHARD
You meant that, but you meant the
other, too.

Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

SETH
(serious as a heart attack)
This ain't the time, Richard.

RICHARD
(his voice rising)
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
that stops the train on its tracks.

SETH
(real quiet and violent)
Keep your voice down.

RICHARD
(quiet back)
Or what?

BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT        

JACOB
Have you forgotten about your sister?

SCOTT
They're gonna kill us. They get us
across the border, they're gonna take
us out in the desert and shoot us.

JACOB
If they get over the border, they're
gonna let us go.

SCOTT
Dad, I watch those reality shows.
They never let anybody go. Any cop
will tell you, in a situation like
this, you get a chance, you go for it.
This is our chance.

JACOB
What about Kate?

SCOTT
They're gonna kill her anyway. At
least now with all these cops we've
got a fighting chance.

JACOB
Son, I have this situation under
control. I know exactly what I'm
doing. You're going to have to trust
me on this.

SCOTT
If trusting you means trusting those
fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
you don't tell the cops, I will.

Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
to him.

JACOB
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
running this show, I make the
decisions.

SCOTT
He's running the show.

JACOB
I'm running the show. I make the
plays, and you back the plays I
make. Stop thinking with your fucking
balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
desperate men with nothing to fucking
lose ain't the time to "go for it."
I need your cover. Cover my ass.

There's a HONK behind them.

They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

BORDER GUARD
How many with you?

JACOB
Just my son and I.

BORDER GUARD
What is your purpose in Mexico?

JACOB
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
first bullfight.

BACK TO BATHROOM

RICHARD
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
thing I did?

SETH
This ain't the time.

RICHARD
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
out? Yeah, you're right, that was
pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
stupid. But you know what? I can fix
that right now.

SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
Richard fall in the bathroom.

BORDER GUARD
What was that?

JACOB
Oh, that's just my daughter in the
bathroom.

BORDER GUARD
You said it was just you and your son.

JACOB
I meant me, my son and my daughter.

CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

BORDER GUARD
Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

BACK TO BATHROOM

CLOSE-UP KATE

We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

KATE
I'm in the bathroom.

BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

KATE
It's open.

We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
face. She's looking up.

BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
on the toilet.

KATE
Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

BORDER GUARD
Excuse me.

He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
the floor of the shower knocked out.

Seth and Kate meet eyes.

He gives her the O.K. signal.

CUT TO:

BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
getting smaller as we drive away from it.

Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

SCOTT
It's clear.

Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

SETH
Goddamn, that was. intense!

Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
farther and farther away. No cars following.

SETH
(to himself)
We did it.
(pause)
We're in Mexico.

Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
along with Scott.

Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
the van.

Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
turns to Kate.

SETH
(loud and happy)
Come here, Kate!

Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
dizzily onto the bed.

SETH
(to Kate)
You were magnificent! You told him to
shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
the shower, and I'm thinking to
myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
do -- he shuts the fucking door!

Kate kind of half smiles.

SETH
If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
fuckin' marry you!

Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

SETH
I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
raised a fuckin' woman.

Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

JACOB
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
Now it's time for your part, letting
us go.

SETH
Pops, when you're right, you're right,
and you are right.

KATE
(suddenly brightens)
You're gonna let us go?

SETH
In the morning, darlin', in the
morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
through hell, and I know I've been one
rough pecker, but from here on end you
guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
Jacob, keep going on this road till
you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
When you get to Digayo, turn this big
bastard left, go on down for a few
miles, then you see a bar called "The
Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
can't miss it.

JACOB
Then?

SETH
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
going.

He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
to Richard.

CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
his face.

SETH (O.S.)
C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
career out of it.

Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
foot of the bed.

SETH
You okay?

RICHARD
(disoriented)
Yeah, I think so. What happened?

SETH
I don't know, you just passed out.

RICHARD
I did?

SETH
Yeah, we were just standing there. You
said something about your shoulder
hurting, then you just hit the ground
like a sack of potatoes.

RICHARD
Really?

SETH
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
the toilet hard. It scared the shit
outta me. Sure you're okay?

RICHARD
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
fucked up.

SETH
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
clear your head right up. We are
officially Mexicans.

RICHARD
What?

SETH
We are...
(singing)
"South of the border down Mexico way."

RICHARD
We are?

SETH
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
right now. We get there, we pound
booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
us to El Ray. And then me and you,
brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
like them apples?

Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

RICHARD
Far out.
(pause)
Where are my glasses?

SETH
They broke when you fell.

RICHARD
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

SETH
Don't worry about it, we'll get you
some glasses.

RICHARD
What dya mean, don't worry about it.
Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
I can't fuckin' see.

SETH
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
of it.

RICHARD
Yeah, like a Mexican
hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
fuckin' prescription.

SETH
It's not a big deal, unless you make
it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
Richie, stop bringing me down with
bullshit.

Jacob calls to the back.

JACOB
Guys! We're here.

CUT TO:

A neon sign that flashes:

THE TITTY TWISTER
Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
by a neon hand.

EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
Mexico.

The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
outside reading things like: 

"NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
"BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
"THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
"DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
"ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
TWISTER DANCERS."

In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

CHET
Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
go. At the Titty Twister we're
slashing pussy in half! This is a
pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
vast selection of pussy! We got white
pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,
wet pussy, tight pussy, big pussy,
bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk
pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin'
pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
it, you don't want it!

The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

SETH
(to the group)
Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
Here's the deal; this place closes at
dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
sometime before dawn. Which by my
guesstimate is somewhere between three
or four hours from now. So we're gonna
go in there, take a seat, have a drink
-- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
for Carlos. That could be an hour,
that could be three hours, I don't
know which. But when he gets here,
me and Richie are going to leave
with him. After we split, you guys
are officially out of this stewpot.
Let me just say I'm real happy about
where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
with me" attitude going on. Now, if
everybody just keeps playin' it cool
-- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
-- everybody's gonna get what they
want. Comprende, amigos?

Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

SETH
Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
I'm buyin'.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
Fuller family step out into the night.

They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

JACOB
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

SETH
Shit, I been to bars make this place
look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

RICHARD
I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
been to some fucked up places in my
time, but that place is fucked up.

Seth can't believe it.

SETH
(in a baby talk voice)
Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
baby too afraid to go into the big
scary bar?

The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
personal.

RICHARD
That's what you think?

SETH
That's how you're lookin', Richie.

RICHARD
I'm lookin' scared?

SETH
That's what you look like.

RICHARD
You know what you look like?

SETH
No, Richie, what do I look like?

RICHARD
You're lookin' green.

That's not what Seth expected to hear.

SETH
How?

RICHARD
Where are you right now?

SETH
What do you mean?

RICHARD
Where are you?

SETH
I'm here with you.

RICHARD
No, you're not. You're sippin'
margaritas in El Ray. But we're
not in El Ray. We're here --
getting ready to go in there.
You're so pleased with yourself
about getting into Mexico, you
think the job's down. It ain't.
Get back on the clock. That's a
fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
there for a coupla hours, in all
likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
So get your shit together, brother.

SETH
My shit is together.

RICHARD
It don't look together.

SETH
Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
just not used to seein' me happy,
'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
years since I been happy. But my shit
is forever together.

Richard believes Seth's response.

RICHARD
Okay, just checkin'.

They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
the microphone.

CHET
(yelling into the microphone)
Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
price, you get another piece of pussy,
of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
If you can find cheaper pussy
anywhere, fuck it!

Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

CHET
(in microphone, towards Kate)
What's this? A new flavor approaching.
Apple Pie Pussy.

SETH
Step aside, asshole.

Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

CHET
Not so fast, Slick.

Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
the BONE SNAPS in two.

Chet lets out a SCREAM.

Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
NOSE.

Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

Chet is OUT.

The whole altercation took two seconds.

Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
everyone.

SETH
Now, is my shit together, or is my
shit together?

Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

RICHARD
(slappin' Seth five)
Your shit is forever together!

They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,

INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
and the beer at closing.

In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
bikers and truckers.

One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
crowd.

Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
Seth is the first to say something.

SETH
Now this is my kinda place! I could
become a regular.

The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
as they approach.

Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
up to the bar.

SETH
Whiskey!

RAZOR CHARLIE
(in English)
You can't come in here.

SETH
What dya mean?

RAZOR CHARLIE
This is a private club. You're not
welcome.

SETH
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
to drink here?

RAZOR CHARLIE
This bar is for bikers and truckers
only.
(points his finger to Seth)
You, get out!

Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

BIG EMILIO
(to Seth in Spanish)
Walk, Pendaho.

Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

SETH
(low)
Take your hand off me.

BIG EMILIO
(Spanish)
I'm going to count to three.

SETH
No, I'm going to count to three.

BIG EMILIO
Uno...

SETH
Two..

Jacob jumps in the middle.

JACOB
Now wait a minute, there's no reason
to get ugly. There's just a
misunderstanding going on here. You
said this bar is for truckers and
bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

Everybody looks at Jacob.

As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

JACOB
If you look outside your door, parked
in your parking lot, you'll see a big
ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
In order to drive that legally, you
need a class two driver's license.
That is the same license that the
DMV requires truck drivers to carry
in order to drive a truck.
(he takes the license out
of his wallet and lays it
on the bar)
That is me, and this is my class two
license. This is a truck driver's bar,
I am a truck driver, and these are
my friends.

Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
everyone in the party and smiles.

RAZOR CHARLIE
(to Jacob)
Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
can I get you?

Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

SETH
Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
But instead he just says,

RAZOR CHARLIE
Coming right up.

Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
buddy punch on the shoulder.

RICHARD
Good job, Pops.

Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

SETH
That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
number one problem with Mexico, it's
not service oriented. I was feelin'
so good, and those fuckin' spies
brought me down.

Richard puts his arm around Seth.

RICHARD
Fuck 'em, shake it off.

Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
at the guy, still pissed.

SETH
You serve food, Jose?

Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
but he just smiles and says,

RAZOR CHARLIE
Best in Mexico.

SETH
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
table, send over a waitress to take
our order.

Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
Charlie's head.

The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

RICHARD
Anytime you want a lap dance with that
broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
words about the party in Spanish.

RAZOR CHARLIE
(in Spanish)
They're not the normal road trash we
normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
No one knows they're here.

The five of them find a table and sit down.

Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

SETH
Who else?

JACOB
Pass.

SETH
(picking a fight)
Why not, against your religion?

JACOB
(won't be baited)
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
now.

SETH
Suit yourself, more for me.
(to Scott)
Scotty?

Scott shakes his head no.

SETH
(to Kate)
How 'bout you?
(pointing at Scott and Kate)
are safer in here with us than
wandering around a Mexican border town
all night long. Just don't do nothin'
stupid and we'll all get along fine.
(to Scott)
Scotty, you sure you don't want a
drink?

SCOTT
Okay, I'll have one.

JACOB
No you won't.

Seth pours Scott a shot.

SETH
Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
up, boy.

Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
on-drinker's tremor.

Seth turns to Kate.

SETH
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
round two?

KATE
Okay.

Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
knocks it back.

RICHARD
(to Seth)
Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
just created a monster.

Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

JACOB
Why are you so agitated?

SETH
I'm still stewing about that ape
laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
too.

JACOB
He backed down.

SETH
He's smilin' at us. But behind his
smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
I hear that loud and clear.

JACOB
What are you going to do?

SETH
(picking up the whiskey bottle)
I'm gonna just sit here and drain
this bottle. And when I've drunk the
last drop, if I still feel then, the
way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
bottle and break it over his melon
head.

JACOB
Before we stepped in here, you told
all of us to be cool. That means you,
too.

SETH
(tossing it off)
I never said do what I do, I said do
what I say.

JACOB
Are you so much a fucking loser, you
can't tell when you've won?

Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
down his drinking glass.

SETH
What did you call me?

JACOB
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
asked a question. Would you like me to
ask it again? Very well. Are you such
a loser you can't tell when you've
won?
(pause)
The entire state of Texas, along with
the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
find you? No. They couldn't. They had
every entrance to the border covered.
There's no way you could get across.
Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
Seth, enjoy it.

Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

SETH
Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
me. I insist.

Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

SETH
To your family.

JACOB
To yours.

They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

JACOB
Now, is your shit together?

SETH
Forever together.

Seth turns to Scott.

SETH
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
it that's yours.

SCOTT
Yeah, it's mine.

SETH
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

CUT TO:

Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
song. Everybody applauds.

Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
that he uses to announce dancers.

RAZOR CHARLIE
(announcer voice in Spanish)
And now for your viewing pleasure. The
Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
of Evil. The most sinister woman to
dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
dogs, get on your knees, bow your
heads and worship at the feet of
SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

The crowd hushes up.

And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
stage, but like she owned the world.

And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
world is proud to be her possession.

All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
accompanies from the table with the guitar.

When the music builds to its explosive section.

Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
room.

She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
She STANDS OVER him.

While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

SANTANICO
(to Richard in Spanish)
Drink up.

Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
surveys.

Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
the beat with his guitar.

Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
Seth and company did to Chet.

Richard continues to suck her toes.

The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
down at the seated Richard.

She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
none louder than Seth.

SETH
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
I call a fuckin' show!

One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
which she puts on.

Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

SETH
(snapping his fingers)
Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
your new friend to join us?

RICHARD
Yeah.

SETH
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

RICHARD
(looking up at Santanico)
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
join us?

SANTANICO
(to Richard)
Muy bien, gracias.

Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

SETH
Richie, you lucky bastard!
(to Santanico)
Now, little lady, you could of just as
easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
arithmetic.

The table laughs.

SETH
Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
Riding Hood is walking through the
forest and she comes across Little Bo
Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
"Little Red Riding Hood, are you
crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
is walking these woods and if he finds
you he's gonna pull down your dress
and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
and taps a .357 Magnum she has
holstered on her thigh and says: "No
he won't."

As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

JACOB
(to himself)
Oh, shit.
(to Seth)
Seth --

Seth waves him away.

SETH
Not now. So finally she comes across
the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
Riding Hood, you know better than to
be walking around these woods alone.
You know I'm just gonna have to pull
down your dress and squeeze your
titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
me, just like the story says."

Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
anything --

The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

RAZOR CHARLIE
(to Chet in Spanish)
Which one?

CHET
(pointing at Seth)
This piece of shit broke my finger
and my nose...
(pointing at Richard)
then this fag kicked me in the ribs
while I was down.

That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

BIG EMILIO
(to The Gecko Brothers)
Up!

RICHARD
Fuck off, ape man!

Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
his wounded shoulder.

Santanico steps back from the table.

Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
and SLASHES Seth across the face.

Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
his laid open cheek.

Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
before he hits the floor.

Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
out of gunfire.

The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
they were doing.

The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
dancing.

Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
something.

Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
and puts it to his face.

RICHARD
How are you?

SETH
Scarred for life, that's how I am!

Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

SETH
You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?

Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
the crowd.

SETH
Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
as dead as these fucks!

SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
to the floor, splattering.

WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
transformation.

Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

KATE
(yelling)
Richie, look out!

Before Richie can turn around.

SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

Seth turns to his brother's cry.

He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
about, trying to knock her off.

Richard screams to Seth:

RICHARD
Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
can't get a clear shot.

Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
rides him down to the floor.

Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
half way before he stops, saying:

RICHARD
(with his dying breath)
Fucking Bitch!

He tumbles over, a corpse.

SETH
Richie.

Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
their faces.

The patrons scream.

A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
and yells:

WHORE
Dinner is served!

The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
VAMPIRES.

The vamps attack.

What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
necks.

Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
anything.

Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
They hide and watch.

Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
motionless, watching what he can't believe.

Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
eyes POP OPEN.

She RISES in her snake/dance way.

Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

SANTANICO
Let's see if you taste as good as your
brother.

She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
bar to the other.

The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
goes head to head with a stripper.

The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
vamp bitch blow for blow.

Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
on the wooden leg.

FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
appears, straight razor in hand.

Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
vampire's death scream.

Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
placed on his chest.

SANTANICO
I'm not gonna drain you completely.
You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
eat bugs because I order it. Because
I don't think you're worthy of human
blood, you'll feed on the blood of
stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
And at my command, you'll lick the dog
shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
be my dog, your new name will be
"Spot". Welcome to slavery.

SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
end over end.

CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

BIG EMILIO
Noooooo!

He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
Jacob.

SETH
We may be in trouble.

Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
Seth and Jacob.

Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
look like a huge walking shark.

Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, you, monkey man!

Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

SEX MACHINE
Anything you gotta say to them, say
to me first.

Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
effortlessly knocks them away.

They both hit the ground.

Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
ahead."

Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
locomotive.

Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
who HITS the floor.

Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
savage beating.

SEX MACHINE
That's enough.

Jacob and Seth stop.

Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
vamp.

Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
around his mouth.

Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

CHET
You know what everybody says about me?
I suck!

Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

GULP.

Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
all the while.

Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
their faces.

Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

CHET
I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

CHET
Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
customers have been butchered or drained.

All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
wooden stakes.

The four human men group together. The four female vampires
charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
staked bodies hit the floor.

Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
side.

They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

FROST
Ain't they supposed to burn up or
something?

At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
light, which lasts only a split second.

It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
once lay.

They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

He takes his dead hand.

SETH
Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
find peace there. I love you little
brother, I'll miss ya bad.

Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

RICHARD
I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
love you, too.

Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

SETH
Touch my brother with that stake,
biker, and vampires won't need to
suck your blood, they'll be able to
lick it up off the floor.

SEX MACHINE
He ain't your brother no more.

SETH
That's a matter of opinion, and I
don't give a fuck about your's.

Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
the ground.

JACOB
Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

Seth aims his gun at the group.

SETH
Shut up!

Richard's giggling.

RICHARD
Yeah, shut up.

Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

SETH
Hold him down.

The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

SETH
Richie, here's the peace in death I
could never give you in life.

Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
the bar.

KATE
Are you okay?

SETH
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
world's my oyster, except for the
fact that I just rammed a wooden
stake in my brother's heart because
he turned into a vampire, even
though I don't believe in vampires.
Aside from that unfortunate business,
everything's hunky-dory.

KATE
I'm really sorry.

SETH
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
a chance you'd feed us to them!

JACOB
Then why didn't I?

Jacob walks over to Seth.

JACOB
I saved your life. I didn't have to,
but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
gonna get out of this we need each
other. And we need you sober and
thinking, not drunk and...

As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
identify it.

JACOB
What the hell is that?

FROST
At first I just thought it was birds.

SEX MACHINE
No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
gnaw.

Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

SETH
It's bats.

EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
inside.

INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
claws poke their way through.

JACOB
Give me a hand!

Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
items to help secure and barricade the door.

As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
room in her direction.

SEX MACHINE
Watch out, girly!

The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

SEX MACHINE
(mumbling to himself)
Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
a loop.

As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

SEX MACHINE
Fire!

Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

FROST
(to Sex Machine)
We'll put this out. You stake the rest
of these fuckers.

SEX MACHINE
Way ahead of ya.
(to Kate)
What's your name, girly?

KATE
Kate, what's yours?

SEX MACHINE
Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
fuckers.

Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
work STAKING the dead bodies.

Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
whatever else is at hand.

A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
in front of the window.

SCOTT
(yelling)
We got a problem!

Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
body through the newly formed hole.

Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
his head back through the hole.

Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
when...

WHAM !

The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
LANDING HARD on his back.

Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

SETH
Get this bastard off of me!

Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
while, then...

BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
the bat-thing.

Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
to try and claw their way in.

JACOB
Is everybody okay?

Everyone mutters "yeah."

JACOB
Okay, does anybody here know what's
going on?

SETH
Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
trying to get inside and suck our
fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
simple. And I don't wanna hear any
bullshit about "I don't believe in
vampires" because I don't fuckin'
believe in vampires either. But I do
believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
vampires! Now, does everybody agree
we're dealin' with vampires.

Everybody agrees.

SETH
You too, preacher?

JACOB
I'm like you. I don't believe in
vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

SETH
Good for you. Now, since we all
believe we're dealing with vampires,
what do we know about vampires?
Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
cross?

JACOB
In the Winnebago.

SETH
In other words, no.

SCOTT
What are you talking about? We got
crosses all over the place. All you
gotta do is put two sticks together
and you got a cross.

SEX MACHINE
He's right. Peter Cushing does that
all the time.

SETH
I don't know about that. In order for
it to have any power, I think it's
gotta be an official crucifix.

JACOB
What's an official cross? Some piece
of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
official? If a cross works against
vampires, it's not the cross itself,
it's what the cross represents. The
cross is a symbol of holiness.

SETH
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
covered, moving right along, what
else?

FROST
Wooden stakes in the heart been
workin' pretty good so far.

SEX MACHINE
Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
forget, does silver do anything to a
vampire?

SCOTT
That's werewolves.

SEX MACHINE
I know silver bullets are werewolves.
But I'm pretty sure silver has some
sort of effect on vampires.

KATE
Does anybody have any silver?

ALL
No.

KATE
Then who cares?

SCOTT
When's sunrise?

Jacob looks at his watch.

JACOB
About two hours from now.

KATE
So all we have to do is get by for a
few more hours and then we can walk
right out the front door.

SEX MACHINE
Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
barricades, that door, those plastered
windows and these walls will last two
more hours with those bat fucks
fuckin' with 'em.

JACOB
Has anybody here read a real book
about vampires, or are we just
remembering what a movie said? I mean
a real book.

SEX MACHINE
You mean like a Time-Life book?

Everybody laughs.

FROST
(in a cowboy voice)
John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
shot a man for snorin'.

JACOB
I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
what do we know about these vampires?

SETH
Aside from they're thirsty.

FROST
Well, one thing, they might got super
human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

JACOB
Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
Santanico didn't kill her, but it
didn't feel too good either.

SEX MACHINE
Another thing, you try and ram a
broken chair leg in a human, you
better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
The human body is one rough-tough
machine. But these vamps got soft
bodies. The texture of their skin is
softer, mushier. You can push shit
right through 'em. Conceivably, if
you hit one hard enough, you could
take their fuckin' head off.

SCOTT
You could take their head off.

SETH
Actually, our best weapon against
these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
(he points at Jacob)
He's a preacher.

Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

SETH
As far as God's concerned, we might
just as well be a piece of fuckin'
shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
one problem, his faith ain't what it
used to be.

Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
Jacob stands over him.

JACOB
I've had enough of your taunts.

Seth looks up from the floor.

SETH
I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
to us. But a man who's a servant of
God can grab a cross, shove it in
these monsters' asses. A servant of
God can bless the tap water and turn
it into a weapon.

Seth rises.

SETH
I know why you lost your faith. How
could true holiness exist if your wife
can be taken away from you and your
children? Now, I always said God can
kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
what's out there trying to get in
here is pure evil straight from hell.
And if there is a hell, and those
monsters are from it, there's got to
be a heaven. Now which are you, a
faithless preacher or a mean,
mother fuckin' servant of God?

Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

JACOB
I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
God.

The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
they're in.

KATE
I don't know if I can take two hours
of that noise.

FROST
You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
with only the rotting corpses of your
friends to keep you company?

JACOB
What are you talking about?

FROST
Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
with my entire squad dead. They
thought they killed everybody, and
except for me, they were right. But it
wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
blew up right next to me, that's why
I'm so pretty.

They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
hour...

As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
say:

MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Thirst.

"Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
Thirst.

We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
Stop fucking saying that!

TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
Thirst!

SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
That bite weren't nothin'. It just
hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
all. It barely punched the skin.

Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
many voices, male, female, children saying:

VOICES (V.O.)
Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
has turned into a vampire.

The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

FROST
...and then when I came back to my
senses, I realized I had killed the
entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
My bayonet had blood and chunks of
yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
shish kabob. And to this day I don't
have the slightest idea how I --

Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

SEX MACHINE
THIRST!

Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
into his neck.

The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
pulling.

Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
bleeding neck.

FROST
I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
sack of potatoes.

He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
table.

Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

FROST
(to Sex Machine)
You're dead, mother fucker! You're
gonna bite me! You just turned me
into a vampire, asshole!

SEX MACHINE
What are you gonna do about it?

Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
straight at Sex Machine.

Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
through the air.

Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

SETH
Oh shit!

Jacob sees.

JACOB
Good lord!

Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
and CRASHES through it.

Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
hand and runs for the backroom.

Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
ground.

Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
howls and snaps in fury.

Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
.45 in its big mouth.

SETH
You wanna suck something, suck on
this!

He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
the wall.

Kate yells:

KATE
We have to go back for Daddy!

SETH
Daddy's dead.

KATE
Noooo!

She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
against the wall.

SCOTT
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
too far away. If flinging that door
and filling this room with those
bat-things would save him, I'd fling
it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
into one of them.

SETH
He needs our help!

SCOTT
He's beyond our help. You saw him get
bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
You can't help him. I've got no one
left to lose but you. I can't be alone
again. We're sticking together.

Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.

INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
repugnant sight trip him up.

Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

JACOB
Open the door.

The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
shut.

Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
bloody arm.

When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

SETH
Did he...?

JACOB
Yep.

Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
over tables and cussing a blue streak.

SETH
Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
creatures on the other side.

SETH
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
you godless pieces of shit!

JACOB
(to Seth)
You bet your sweet ass you are, and
I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
got much time.

Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

KATE
You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
daddy?

JACOB
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
I'm already dead.

Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

JACOB
(to his children)
Children, listen to me. I love you two
more than anybody. And I just want you 
to know you've made me proud all your
lives. But never more so than tonight.
And I wish we could sit here and cry
till I pass on, but we can't. Because
I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
turn into a monster. And when I do,
I'm going to be dangerous. But before
that happens, just know I love you.
(to Seth and the kids)
Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
thirty minutes our friends outside
will bust in this door. And I'll
probably turn into a vampire within
the hour. Now, you have two choices.
You can wait for me to turn, then deal
with me, then wait for them to burst
inside here and the three of you will
deal with them. Or, we can kick open
that door and the four of us can hit
'em with everything we have, and carve
a path right through 'em to front
entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
them, I scared them, I took them off
guard. But they're going to get
unconfused, they're going to get
unscared, they're going to get
together and they're going to hit that
door like a ton of bricks. And when
that moment arrives, we gotta be
ready.

Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
with boxes and crates.

JACOB
What's this stuff?

SETH
My guess is that this little dive's
been feeding on nomad road waifs like
bikers and truckers for a longtime.
This is probably some of the
shipments they stole off the trucks.

JACOB
Well, I say lets tear this place apart
for weapons. So when they burst
through that door, we'll make 'em wish
they never did.

SETH
I don't give a shit about living or
dying anymore. I just want to send as
many of these devils back to hell as
I can.

JACOB
Amen.

MONTAGE

The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
backroom sink.

Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
getting their courage back.

Kate makes water balloons.

Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
turning it into holy water.

Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
pounding, squeaking and screaming.

Finally they're ready.

Jacob turns to his kids.

JACOB
Before we go any further, I need you
three to promise me something. I'll
fight with you to the bitter end,
but when I turn into one of them, I
won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
promise you'll take me down, no
different from the rest.

The kids can't say the words.

SETH
I promise.

JACOB
Kate, Scott?

KATE
I promise.

JACOB
Scott?

SCOTT
Yeah, I promise.

Jacob doesn't believe them.

JACOB
Why don't I believe you?
(he picks up the .45)
I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
want you to swear to God that you'll
kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
just kill myself right now. Now,
since you need me I think you better
swear. Kate, do you swear to God
that when I turn into one of the
undead, you'll kill me?

Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
temple.

JACOB
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
only gonna count to five. One...two...
three... four...

KATE
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

JACOB
Not good enough, swear to God.

KATE
I swear to God, our father, that when
you change into one of the undead, I
will kill you.

JACOB
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
less time, so I'm only giving you the
count of three. One...

SCOTT
You don't believe in suicide.

JACOB
It's not suicide if you're already
dead. Two...

SCOTT
Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

JACOB
Thank you, son.

SETH
Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
fuckin' vampires.

INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
the door.

Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
starting up the jackhammer.

SETH
Kill 'em all!

Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
flesh.

The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
forward.

They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
the door.

Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
green vamp blood.

Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
other.

Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
toss them into the crowd.

They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
in pain.

From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
HURLS toward the group.

Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
the hammer stake into vampire chests.

The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
junk.

SCOTT
(yelling)
Why did they block the door again?

JACOB
(yelling)
To keep the daylight out! This is
where they sleep! Get to the door!

Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
off the ground.

Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
he CRASHES into a table.

The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
sticking out of his chest, dead.

Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
screams:

KATE
Seth!

Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

SETH
Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
and feel all right!

Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

KATE
(yelling)
I'm going for 'em!

JACOB
No!

KATE
Everybody goes home!

Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
Seth's direction.

KATE
(screaming)
Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
couple of water balloons and a stake.

KATE
(to Seth)
Watch my back!

SETH
Anytime.

Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
bar.

Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
fiery death.

Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
His eyes are yellow.

Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
up to fire.

A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
with the boy he once called his son.

Scott's eyes turn to steel.

SCOTT
I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
name.

He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
head bursts into flames, then explodes.

From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

SETH
Fight now, cry later.

Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
it bites into him. He drops the .45.

Kate sees Scott get bit.

KATE
Oh my god.

Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
Scott screams.

KATE
You bastards!

She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
Scott is in agony.

SCOTT
Kill me, Kate! 

Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
times.

One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

The remaining vamps approach.

All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
balloon.

SETH
How many bullets left, kid?

KATE
Not many.

SETH
Well, when you run out of weapons,
just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
sing for their supper.

The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
holding the .45, arm outstretched.

KATE
(to Seth)
Should I use the last bullets on us?

SETH
You use 'em on the first couple of
these parasites that try to bite you.

The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
on the face of an approaching vampire.

Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

SETH
Shoot more holes!

Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
Seth with a safe, lighted area.

The .45's empty.

The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
able to get at them.

The two survivors hold hands, when...

All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
from the outside.

The vamps look towards it in horror.

From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
Spanish accent.

VOICE (O.S.)
(in Spanish)
I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
there?

SETH
(yelling)
Carlos!
(in Spanish)
Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
in!

CARLOS (O.S.)
(in Spanish)
Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
Hurry, hurry!

The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
each other.

The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
door.

The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
in fright.

Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
combust in fiery explosions.

The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
door into the parking lot.

EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
Carlos's Mercedes.

CARLOS
(to Seth)
What the fuck was going on in there?

Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

CARLOS
(in Spanish)
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

SETH
Why the fuck, outta all the god
forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
have us rendezvous at that place?

CARLOS
I don't know, one place's as good as
another.

SETH
Have you ever been there before?

CARLOS
No, but I passed by it a couple of
times. It's out in the middle of
nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
And it's open from dusk till dawn.
You said meet you in the morning.

SETH
Well, because you picked that place
out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
And this girl's family's dead.

Carlos stands up again.

CARLOS
I'm sorry to hear that. What were
they, psychos?

SETH
Did they look like psychos? They
were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
don't care how crazy they are.

Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
themselves again.

CARLOS
Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
to you?

SETH
You can't, but fifteen percent instead
of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
good start.

CARLOS
Twenty-eight.

SETH
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
dead and he's not coming back, and
it's all your fault. Twenty.

They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

SETH AND CARLOS
(in Spanish)
Twenty-five.

Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
to a red 1990 Porsche 911.

CARLOS
You like the car?

SETH
I said new, this is an '90.

CARLOS
It's hardly been used at all. I got it
from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
times in as many years. Swear to God.
That's like new.

SETH
So do I just follow you?

CARLOS
Yeah, follow us.

SETH
So let's do it.

CARLOS
(to Danny and Manny)
Vamanos!

Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

Kate stands alone.

The whole desert seems between them.

So much to say ... but no words.

SETH
I'm sorry.

KATE
Me too.

Long pause.

SETH
See ya.

KATE
Later.

Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
says behind him:

KATE (O.S.)
Seth.

Seth turns around.

KATE
You want some company?

Seth smiles.

SETH
Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

He blows her a kiss across the desert.

She blows one back.

Seth's in his car and GONE.

Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
begins her long walk home.

THEME OF MOVIE BEGINS POUNDING

THE END
FADE IN:
Chapter One
Last Stage to Red Rock
Got room for one more?
Who the hell are you,
and what happened to them?
Names Major Marquis Warren former U.S.
Calvary.
Currentrly I'm a
servant of the court.
Tryin' to bringin' a coupla'
no-goods into market.
I got paperwork on 'em in my pocket.
You takin' 'em into Red Rock?
I figure that's where you headed, right?
That damblasted blizzards
been on our ass for the last three hours.
Ain't no way we gonna make it all the
way to Red Rock 'fore it catches us.
So ya' hightailin' it
halfway to Minnie's Haberdashery?
You know I am.
- May I come aboard?
- Well smoke...
it up to me, yes.
- But it ain't up to me.
- Who's it up to?
Fella in the wagon.
Fella' in the wagon not partial to company?
Fella' in the wagon he paid for a private
trip. And i'm here to tell ya'...
he paid a pretty penny for privacy.
So if you wanna' go to Minnie's with us...
- you gotta' talk to him.
- Well...
that's what i'll do.
Hold it black fella'!
'fore you approach,
you take them two guns of yours and
lay 'em on that rock over yonder.
Then you raise both
your hands way above your hat.
Then you approach....
molasses-like.
Real trustin' fella', huh?
Not so much.
Put 'em down.
Come on ahead.
I said way above your hat, god dammit.
Now come forward.
That's far enough.
I'll be dogged,
you black fella' i know.
Col. Something Warren, right?
Major Marquis Warren.
I know you too.
We shared a steak dinner
once upon a time in Chattanooga.
You John Ruth, The Hangman.
That be me.
- How longs that been?
- Since that steak?
Eight months.
So why don't you explain to me...
what an african bounty
hunter's doin' wanderin'
around in the snow in
the middle of Wyoming.
I'm tryin' to get a coupla'
of bounty's to Red Rock.
So you still in business?
You know I am.
What happened to your horse?
Circumstances caused us to take the long
way around. My horse couldn't make it.
You don't know nothin'
about this filly here?
Nope.
Don't even know your name?
Nope.
Well I guess that makes
this one fortuitous wagon.
I sure as hell hope so.
Major Marquis Warren,
this here is Daisy Domergue.
Domergue, to you, this is Maj.
Warren.
Howdy nigger!
She's a pepper, ain't she?
Now girl, don't you know
darkee's don't like bein'
called niggers no more.
They find it offensive.
- I been called worse.
- Now that I can believe.
- Heard of her?
- Should I?
Well she ain't no John Wilkes Booth, but...
maybe you might of heard
tell 'bout the price on her head.
- How much?
- Ten thousand dollars.
Damn, what she do?
Kill Lily Langtree?
Not quite.
Now that ten thousand's
practically in my pocket.
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides.
Especially to professionals
open for business.
Well I certainly can appreciate that.
I ain't got no designs on her.
One of my fella's over
there is worth four
thousand, one's worth
three, and one's worth one.
That's damn sure good enough for me.
Well...
Let me see their paperwork.
Like I said, molasses-like.
Back off.
Look...
I sure hate to interrupt y'all!
But we gtta' cold damn blizzard,
hot on our asses we tryin'
to beat to shelter!
I realize that!
Now shut your mouth
and hold them damn horses while I think!
Okay boy, we'll give it a try.
But you leave those pistols
over yonder with the driver.
You ain't really gonna'
let that nigger ridin' in
here is ya'? I mean maybe
up there with O.B., but-
How you like the sound
of them bells, bitch?
They are real pretty, ain't they?
You open up your trashy
mouth again, I'll knock
out them front teeth for ya'.
You got it?
Yeah.
Let me hear you say: "I got it."
I got it.
Well, I'm gonna need some help tyin'
these fella's up on the roof.
Give O.B. fifty dollars when
ya' get to Red Rock, and he'll help ya'.
Well, I agree with O.B.
This storm's got me concerned.
We get goin' a lot
quicker you help out too.
Goddamit to hell, I'm
already regretting this!
Now I can't likely help ya' tie fella's
to the roof with my wrist cuffed to hers.
And my wrist is gonna'
stay cuffed to hers, and
she ain't never gonna'
leave my goddamn side,
until I personally put her in the
Red Rock jail! Now do you got that?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.
Translation/Timings/Creator by: Deluce
So what happend to your horse?
He got old.
I done had him for a bit.
When the weather took a
turn for the worse, he
done what he could, but
he couldn't make it.
- That's too bad.
- Yes it is.
Me an' ole Lash rode a
lotta' miles together.
You could say he was
my best friend- if I
considered stupid animals
firends, which I don't.
Never the less....
I'm gonna' miss 'em.
Who's Daisy Domergue?
A no damn good murdering
bitch, that's who.
I can see you ain't got mixed emotions
'bout bringing a woman to a rope.
- If by woman, you mean her?
No I do not have mixed emotions.
So you takin' her into Red Rock to hang?
- You bet.
- Gonna' wait to watch it?
You know I am.
I wanna' hear her neck
snap with my own two ears.
You never wait to watch 'em hang?
My bounties never hang,
cause I never bring 'em in alive.
Never?
Never ever.
We talked about this in Chattanooga.
Bringing desperate men in alive,
is a good way to get yourself dead.
Can't catch me sleepin'
if I don't close my eyes.
I don't wanna' work that hard.
No one said the job
was suppose to be easy.
No one said
it was suppose to be that hard, nether.
But that little lady,
is why they call him "The Hangman".
When the handbill says
Dead or Alive, the rest of
us shoot ya' in the back
from up on top of a perch
somewhere, bring ya' in dead over a saddle.
But when John Ruth The Hangman catches ya',
you don't die by a bullet in the back.
When The Hangman catches you...
you hang.
You overrate 'em nigger.
I'll give you he got guts.
But in the brains department,
he like a man who took a
high dive in a low well.
Now Daisy,
I want us to work out a
signal system of communication.
When I elbow you real hard in the face...
that means:
You got it?
I got it.
I...
I know we only met each other once before.
And I don't mean to unduly
imply intimacy. But...
Well...
You still got it?
I still got, what?
The Lincoln letter?
Of course.
Do you got it on you?
Where?
Right here.
Look, I know you gotta'
be real careful with it and all.
I can imagine you probably
don't like to take
it in an'out of the
envelope all that often.
But if you wouldn't mind,
i'd sure appreciate seein' that again.
You right,
I don't like taking it in an'out
of the envelope that much.
- Yeah.
- But...
as your saving my life an' all,
I suppose I could let you read it again.
"Ole Mary Todd's callin',
so I guess it must be time for bed"
Ole Mary Todd.
That gets me.
That gets me too.
You know what this is, tramp?
It's a letter from Lincoln.
It's a letter from Lincoln to him.
They shared a correspondence
during the war.
They was pen pals.
This is just one of the letters.
What the...
O.B.
Stop!
Whoa, easy.
Of all the stupid,
like to rip my goddamn arm off!
I didn't,
drag her stikin' ass up
this goddamn mountain, just
for you to break her neck
on the ouskirts of town.
You the one handed her my goddamn letter.
I didn't give it to her,
I gave it to you!
That nigger like to bust my jaw.
You ruin that letter of his,
that niggers gonna' stomp your
ass to death. And when he do,
I'm gonna sit back on that
wagon wheel watch and laugh.
How is it?
She didn't help it none.
But it's alright.
Is that the way niggers treat their ladies?
You... ain't no goddamn... lady!
Hey Mister Ruth?
What?
There's another fella' on foot,
up here on the road!
What?
I said, there's another fella' on foot,
up here on the road!
Considering there's a blizzard goin' on,
whole lotta' fellas walkin' around,
wouldn't you say, Major?
Considerin I'm one half
of them fellas, yeah...
seems to be a lot of 'em.
This changes things, son.
Eight thousand dollars a
lotta' money for a nigger.
But with a partner,
eighteen's a whole lot better.
You really think I'm
in cahoots wit' that fella'? Or her?
- Put them on.
- I ain't wearin' handcuffs.
You put those on or you can stop worryin'
about this whole thing, right now.
Chapter Two Son of a Gun
Hand your weapons to the driver.
Little jumpy, ain't you?
Never mind the jokes, just do it.
- If you say so.
- I do.
Okay...
I done did it.
O.B.?
Ya' got 'em?
- I got 'em!
- Okay fella',
you keep holdin'
that lantern in that one hand,
and you keep that other
hand where I can see it.
Walk over there where I can
get a good look at cha'.
I'll be a goddamn dog in the manger.
Is that you Chris Mannix?
- I'm sorry friend, do we know each other?
- Not quite.
- You know this fella'?
- Only by reputation.
Like I said friend,
you got me at a bit of a disadvantage.
Keepin' you at a disadvantage,
is a advantage I intend to keep.
Whoever you are mister,
you sure sound tough when you're talkin'
to a desperate man knee deep in snow.
I don't want no trouble.
I just wanna' ride.
I'm freezin to death.
Who is this joker.
You heard of the rebel
renegade Erskine Mannix?
- Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.
The scourge of South
Carolina, Mannix Marauders.
That's Erskine's youngest boy, Chris.
What brings you in my path, Chris Mannix?
Well Mr. Face,
I was riding to Red Rock and my horse
stepped in a gopher hole in the snow,
fucked up his leg,
an' had to put 'er down.
You got business in Red Rock?
- Yes I do.
- What?
I'm the new sheriff.
- Horseshit.
- 'fraid not.
- Where is your star?
- Well I ain't the sheriff yet.
Once I get there they swear me in,
but that ain't happened yet.
And that's when
you get your star.
You got anything that
can back any of this up?
Yeah.
When we get to Red Rock.
And from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there,
I figure you're a bounty hunter
open for business.
And I figure you're taking them three
dead bodies into Red Rock to get paid?
Three dead.
One alive.
- Who's that?
- Daisy Domergue.
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?
Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.
The Hangman?
Well I'll be double dogged damned.
- You're The Hangman, Bob Ruth.
- It's John.
And you...
your're the nigger with the head...
Major Marquis.
My lord, is that really the real head
of Major Marquis, lookin' at me now?
Yeah it's really me and
it's really my head.
What's goin' on, y'all havin'
a bounty hunters picnic?
Never mind, you takin' in
them three dead bodies
and her to Red Rock
to get paid, ain't ya'?
Yeah.
Well...
the man is red Rock suppose
to pay you is me. The new sherrif.
So if you wanna get paid,
you need to get me to Red Rock.
Well execuse me for findin'
it hard to belive a
town electin' you to do
anything except drop dead.
So I'm suppose to freeze death,
'cause you find something hard to belive?
No I suppose not.
Put them on and come inside.
No.
- Then you'll freeze.
- Then you'll hang.
How so?
Driver!
Could you come down here and join us?
I gotta hold these horses
I can hear you just fine from up here.
You heard me tell this fella'
I'm the new sheriff of Red Rock, right?
Yeah.
Red Rock is my town.
And I'm gonna' enter my town
in bounty hunters chains? No Sir!
Sorry bushwackers,
I ain't entering Red Rock that way.
When you finally get to
Red Rock, you're going
to realize every goddamn
thing I said was right.
And I expect you, O.B.,
to tell the townsfolk
of Red Rock that John
Ruth, let their new
sheriff freeze to death.
There ain't no bounty
on my head, bushwacker.
You let me die, that's murder.
Hold out your hands.
O.B.
Give the Major back his iron.
One thing I know for sure,
this nigger-hatin'
son of a gun ain't partnered up with you.
Now...
I'll help protect your eight thousand,
you help me protect my ten,
deal?
Ain't love grand. Y'all wanna' lie on
the ground and make snow angels together?
- Tell ya' what, Bob-
- The name's John.
When we get to Red Rock, I'll buy you and
Major Marquis there dinner and booze.
- May way of sayin' thanks.
- I don't drink,
with rebel renegades,
and I damn sure don't break bread with 'em.
Well Mr. Ruth,
you sound like you got
a axe to grind against The Cause.
The cause of a renegade army?
A bunch of losers gone loco, you bet I do.
Ya' wrapped yourselves up in the
Rebel Flag as an excuse to kill and steal.
And this should interest you Warren,
imparticular emancipated blacks.
Sounds like my kinda' fella'.
Sounds to me you been readin' a lotta'
newspapers printed in Washington D.C.
Anywho, I'm just tryin'
to let y'all know grateful I am.
I was a goner, and
y'all saved me.
You wanna' show me how
grateful you are...
shut up!
God damnit, Daisy it's comin'.
Here, last piece.
Does he know how famous you once was?
I don't think so.
Black eye.
Do you know who he is?
Do I know about the thirty
thousand dollar reward
the Confederacy put on the
head of Major Marquis?
Yeah.
Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting,
but they never did
get 'em the right nigger head, did they?
No they didn't.
But it wasn't for lack of tryin'.
Them peckawoods left their homes and their
families, and come to this snowy mountain,
lookin' for me and fortune.
None of them found fortune.
The ones you ain't ever heard of no more,
they found me.
Now it didn't stay 30
thousand the length of the war.
Once passions had colled,
it dropped down to eight, then five.
But, I bet even
when it was five thousand,
you had your share
of country boys comin' to call?
You know I did.
Why did they have a reward on you?
The Confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing them.
After I broke out of Wellenbeck,
The South took my continued
existence as a personal affront.
So The Cause put a reward on my head.
What's...
Wellenbeck?
You ain't never heard of Wellenbeck
prisoner of war camp, West Virginia?
No Reb, I ain't never heard of it!
You bust out?
Maj. Marquis did more than bust out.
Maj. Marquis had a bright idea.
So bright...
you got to wonder,
why nobody never thought about it before.
Tell John Ruth about your bright idea.
Well the whole damn place
was just made out of kindling.
So I burnt it down.
There was a rookie regiment
spendin' the overnight in that camp.
Forty-seven men...
burnt to a crisp.
Southern youth, farmer's sons,
- cream of the crop-
- And I say, "Let 'em burn".
I'm suppose to apologize
for killin' Johnny Reb?
You joined the war to
keep niggers in chains.
I joined the war to
kill White Southern
Crackers And that means
kill 'em anyway I can.
Shoot 'em. Stab 'em.
Drown 'em. Burn 'em.
Drop a big ole' rock on their head.
Whatever it took to put
White Southern Crackers in the ground
that's what I joined the war to do,
and that's what I did.
To answer your question, John Ruth,
when Major Marquis
burned forty seven men alive,
for no more a reason then to give
a nigger a run for the trees,
that's when The South put a reward
on the head of Major Marquis.
And I made them trees, Mannix.
And you best belive I ain't look back
till I crossed The Northern Line.
But you had a surprise waitin' for you
on The Northern Side, didn't ya'?
See once they started pullin' out
all the burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,
seems not all of them boys were Rebs.
You burnt up some of your own boys,
didn't ya' Major?
How many burnt prisoners
they end up findin'?
Wasn't the final Yankee death count
somethin' like thirty-seven?
That's the thing about war Mannix,
people die.
So ya' chalkin' it up to "War Is Hell", ha?
Well admittedly that's a hard argument
to argue with. But if memory serves,
your side didn't look at it that way.
I think they thought,
thirty-seven white men for one nigger
wasn't so hot a trade.
I belive they accused you
of being a kill crazy nigger who
only joined the war to kill white folks
and the whole Blue and Grey
of it all didn't really much matter to ya'.
And that's why they drummed
your black ass outta'
the Cavalry with a yellow
stripe down your back.
Isn't it Major?
Horse shit.
If he did all that, the
Cavalry woulda' shot him.
I didn't say they could prove it.
But they sure did think it out loud,
didn't they Major?
But,
Warren's war record was stellar,
and that's what saved his ass.
Are you killed
yourself your share of
redskins in your day,
didn't ya' Black Major?
Cavalry tends to
look kindly on that.
I'll tell a' what The Cavalry
didn't look kindly on.
Mannix's Marauders that's what.
And the fact that Erskine
Mannix's little boy
would talk about anybody
else's behavior
during war time makes
me wanna horse laugh.
Don't you say anything about my daddy,
what he fought for,
was dignity in defeat,
and against the unconditional surrender.
We weren't foreign barbatians
pounding on the city walls.
We were your brothers.
- We deserved dignity in defeat.
- Just,
how many nigger towns did y'all sack
in your fight for dignity in defeat?
My faire share, Black Major.
'Cuz when niggers are scared,
that's when white folks are safe.
You gonna talk
that hateful nigger talk,
you ride up top wtih O.B.
No no no,
you got me talkin' politics
I didn't wanna'.
Like I said y'all,
I'm just happy to be alive.
I...
I think I'll just look out this winda'
let this beatuiful
carriage rock me to sleep.
And dream about how lucky I am.
Chapter Three
Minnie's Haberdashery
Get in there.
Easy.
What the hell's going on,
we weren't expecting another stage tonight?
I can see
you already got another one up in here.
I just got through putting the horses away.
This ain't the normal line. But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like you're stuck with us.
Are Minnie and Sweet Dave inside?
They ain't here.
I'm running the place while they're gone.
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?
He says they ain't here. He's lookin'
after the place while they gone.
Who are you?
I'm Bob.
Well whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.
Get 'em outta this cold,
before that blizzard hit's 'em.
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.
I got two of my best men on it.
You heard him freeloaders,
get to work.
Come on let's go!
- Open up!
- Kick it open!
- What?
- Kick it open!
Shut that door,
there's a goddamn blizzard out there!
- You gotta' nail it shut!
- You have to nail it shut!
- Hold it shut!
- There's a hammer and nails by the door!
You have to nail it shut!
There's a hammer and nails by the door!
- Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.
You need to do two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!
- Two pieces of wood.
- That fuckin' thing is busted!
Not just one piece of wood.
- Gimme that other piece of wood.
- Yeah, allright.
- Gimme the nail.
- Here.
Jesus.
That door's a son of a gun.
Who's the idiot who broke that,
that Mexican fella'?
Good heavens,
a woman
out in this white hell.
You must be frozen solid, poor thing.
Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.
When did you fella's arrive?
About forty minutes ago.
The Cowboy fella' in the
courner, is that your driver?
No he's a passenger.
The driver lit out. He
said he was going to
spend the blizzard shacked
up with a friend.
Jesus Christ, that's awful!
Christ almighty, what that Mexican fella'
do, soak his ole socks in the pot?
I think we all felt the same way, but were
a little too polite to say something.
- He don't have that problem.
. Where's the well water?
Over there.
So,
all three of you fellas' headed to Red
Rock, when the blizzard stopped ya', huh?
Yes, all three of us
were on that stagecouch out there.
Coffybeans?
Over there.
Get your hand outta' there.
The new sheriff of Red
Rock is traveling with us.
Sheriff of Red Rock,
that'll be the day.
If he is a goddamn sheriff,
I'm a monkey's uncle.
Good.
Then you can share bananas
with your nigger friend in the stable.
So...
the new sheriff of Red
Rock is traveling with you?
No he's lyin'
he ain't sheriff of nothin'
He's a southern renegade. He's just talkin'
his self outta' freezin' to death, is all.
What the fuck I tell you
about talkin', huh?
I'll bust you in the mouth right in
front of these people, I don't give a fuck!
You never gave your name, sir.
John Ruth.
- Are you a lawman?
- I'm takin' her to the law.
- You're a bounty hunter?
- That's right, Buster.
- Do you have a warrant?
- 'Course I do.
May I see it?
Why?
You're suppose to produce it upon request.
How am I suppose to know,
you're not a villain,
kidnapping this woman
without a warrant in your possession?
What's your name, Buster?
Well...
it certainly isn't Buster.
It's Oswaldo Mobray.
- Oswaldo?
- Yes.
Well...
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.
- I take it you're Daisy Domergue?
- Yeah it's her.
- It says here, Dead or Alive?
- Yeah it does.
Transporting a desperate
hostile prisoner such as her
sounds like hard work.
Wouldn't transporting her be easier
if she were dead?
No one said the job
was suppose to be easy.
And why is her hanging proper,
so important to you?
Let's just say I don't like to cheat the
hangman. He's gotta' make a living too.
Well I appreciate that.
Allow me to properly introduce myself.
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,
The Hangman in these parts.
- Looks like I brought you a customer.
- So it would appear.
Have you ever spent two days or more
locked up with one of your customers?
No I can't say I have.
Don't talk to my prisoner. I talk to
my prisoner, that's it. You got it?
I got I got. Jolly good.
You got anything in here besides
coffee that can help warm us up?
The Bar is open, follow moi.
All right.
All right.
Come on, goddamnit I'm cold!
I'll feed and water the horses.
You go inside and get some hot coffy.
I've got some stew cooking.
Should be done soon.
Now look...
now matter how bad this blizzard gets,
we still gotta' feed these horses
and take a squat from time to time.
So me an' Chris better lay out a line
from the stable to the front door,
and from the front door to the shithouse.
Okay?
Good idea.
Come on, Chris.
I'll give you a hand.
No no no, go inside, get warm.
You're doing stable work in a goddamn
blizzard, I offer to help and you say no?
You're right, mi amigo.
Muchas gracias.
All right, follow me.
We gonna' drop one,
every ten paces.
- From here to the door.
- Yeah! - All right.
Now, you're wanted for murder.
For the sake of my analogy,
let's just assume that you did it.
John Ruth wants to take you back to
Red Rock to stand trail for murder.
And, if...
you're found guilty,
the people of Red Rock will hang you in the
town square. And as the hangman,
I will perform the execution.
And if all those things
end up taking place,
that's what civilized
society calls "justice".
However,
if the relatives and the
loved ones of the person
you murdered were outside
that door right now.
And after busting down that
door, they drug you out
in the snow and hung you
up by the neck, that,
we would be frontier justice.
Now the good part
about frontier justice is
it's very thirst quenching.
The bad part is
it's apt to be Wrong as Right.
Not in your case. In
your case, you'd have it
comin'. But other people,
maybe not so much.
But ultimately what's the
real difference between the two?
The real difference is Me...
The Hangman.
To me, it dosen't matter what you did.
When I hang you, I
will get no satisfaction from your death.
It's my job.
I hang you in red Rock, I move on to the
next town, I hang someone else there.
The man who pulls the lever,
that breaks your neck
will be a dispassionate man.
And that dispassion is
the very essence of
justice. For justice delivered
without dispassion,
is always in danger of not being justice.
Amen.
No offense cowboy fella',
just gettin' your attention.
Yeah, well...
you got it.
What'cha writing firend?
- Only thing I'm qualified to write about.
- What's that?
My life story.
- You're writing your life story?
- You bet I am.
Am I in it?
You just entered.
Well you like writing
stories so much, why don't
you tell me the story
that brings you here?
- Who's askin'?
- I am.
John Ruth. I'm bringin' in
this one to Red Rock to hang.
Ain't no way I'm spendin'
a coupla' nights under a
roof with somebody I don't
know who you they are.
And I don't know who you are.
So...
who are you?
- Joe Gage.
- What?
That's my name, Joe Gage.
Okay Joe Gage, why you goin' to Red Rock?
- I ain't goin' to Red Rock.
- Where you goin'?
- About nine miles outside of Red Rock.
- What's there?
My mother.
Your mother?
Listen,
I'm just a cow puncher I just...
I got back from a long drive and...
I wasn't just an ass in a saddle this time,
I was a partner.
For the first time in my life I,
made a pretty penny and, eh....
Come home and spend time with
my mother for Christmas.
Now that's funny.
'Cuz you don't look like the
coming home for Christmas type.
Yeah, well...
you know, looks
can be deceiving.
Because I definitely am a...
coming home for Christmas to
spend time with mother type.
Christmas with Mother?
I mean...
it's a wonderful thing.
Now is that... good
enough for you?
John Ruth?
For now.
Just steer clear of my prisoner.
Hello old timer.
General.
General.
You sir,
are a Hyena.
And I have no wish to speak to you.
I've been called worse.
Fair enough, General.
Sorry to bother you.
- You gonna' kick it open.
- Kick it open.
It's already cold enough in here.
It dosen't have latch you
gonna' hammer up a board.
You gotta' nail it shut!
- The hammer and nails is by the door.
- There is a hammer and nails right there!
Oh god,
- Holdin' this Chris.
- Here, here.
You need to nail it in!
You need two pieces of wood.
You gotta' hammer another one.
One ain't good enough!
It's gonna' blow right open.
- Goddamn it!
- It's gotta' open if you don't.
- Shut up!
- I got it! Son of a bitch!
Jesis Christ,
that door's a whore!
I get it, haberdashery,
that was a joke.
How's the coffy?
Now, pretty good, if I do say so myself.
Thank you.
Guess who he is?
Buffalo Bill?
Hardly, no.
- I'm Oswaldo Mobray, I'm The-
- He's the hangman of Red Rock.
- Oh, you are?
- Yes I am.
Well good to meet you Mr.?
- Mobray.
- Mobray, I'm Chris Mannix,
- the new sheriff in Red Rock.
- Really?
Horseshit!
- Pay no attention to him.
- Horseshit!
Fella' warmin' himself by the that pot
by the stove is a hell of driver named O.B.
That's the only thing you
said that's the truth.
You comin' into Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson?
Precisely.
- Do you have the execution orders on you?
- In my beg.
- May I see 'em?
- Of course.
Who's Lance Lawson?
He's a fell' been sittin' in the
Red Rock jail about a month now.
He's the fella - who shot the fella' -
who was sheriff 'fore me.
Precisely.
What did she mean when she said,
bounty hunter's nigger
friend in the stable?
He's got a nigger
bounty hunter firend in the stable.
But all that
just to guard her?
I don't think that was
the original idea, but...
that's the idea now.
- Want a lil' snakebite in your coffy?
- Yeah.
Five of you?
Well, well, well, looks
like Minnie's Haberdashery
is about to get cozy
for the next few days.
Yes it does.
Who's the chap with the Lincoln letter?
The Lincoln what?
The letter from Abraham Lincoln?
President Abraham Lincoln?
- Weren't you pen pals?
- With the President?
I'm sorry, I heard somebody
in your party had a
letter from Abraham Lincoln,
I assumed it was you.
Not him!
The black fella' in the stable.
The nigger in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
Yeah.
The nigger in the stable
has a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
Say your name was again?
- Bob.
- Warren.
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?
Minnie and Sweet Dave went to visit her
mother on the north side of the mountain.
- What?
- Yeah.
- They ain't here?
- Yes, they're visiting her mother.
- Her mother?
- Yes.
I never knew Minnie had a mother.
Everybody's got a mother.
Yeah, I suppose.
- And she left you in charge?
- Si.
That sure don't sound like Minnie.
Are you callin' me a liar?
Not yet, I ain't.
- But it sounds peculiar, though,
- What sound peculiar?
Well first of, Minnie never struck me
as the sentimental type.
Secondly,
I can't imagine Sweet
Dave liftin' his fat ass
outta' his chair long
enough to fetch well water,
unless Minnie was
layin' a fryin' pan upside his head.
Along takin' trips to the north side.
That sounds a whole lot like you're calling
me a liar, mi negro amigo.
Yeah it do sound a whole
lot like, don't it?
But I still haven't done it yet.
Minnie still serve food?
- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes. - Then we serve food.
She still stinkin' up the place
with her "Old Quail" pipe tobacco?
Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.
She rolls her own.
"Red Apple Tobacco"
But mi negro amigo,
I think you already know this.
Yeah I do, Senor Bob.
Just seein' if you do.
- Fill me up, O.B.
- Yeah.
Goddamn it!
Thank you.
Well cut my legs off and call me Shorty...
is that Genaral Sanford Smithers I see?
You've got a good eye son.
Well, I'll be double dogged damned!
General Sandy "Don't give a damn" Smithers!
Captain Chris Mannix, Mannix Marauders.
- Erskine's boy?
- Yes sir.
May I sit down, Sir?
According to the Yankees,
it's a free country.
Genaral Sandy Smithers...
boy...
oh boy.
Did my daddy talk about you.
I heard you gave those
Blue Bellies sweet hell.
Me and my boys did our part.
Just like Erskine and
his boys did their part.
Hell yeah, we did.
- Yankees sons of bitches?
- I never knew your father, son.
But, I always respected his resolve.
Thank you for saying that, General. Your
respect woulda' meant the world to him.
Can I get ya' some coffy?
- That would be nice.
- Well, how about a blanked?
That would be even nicer.
Hell, you know what,
you can have mine.
Here we go General.
So what brings you out Wyoming way, sir?
If ya' don't mind me askin'?
My boy.
You gotta' boy that lives in Red Rock?
My son, Chester
Charles Smithers,
he died out here a few years back.
Forgive me sir.
No forgiveness needed, son.
Like I said, it was a few years back.
It was after he served his service.
He came out here to the hills of Wyoming,
to make his fortune.
Never to be heard from again.
I bought him a symbolic plot
in the Red Rock cemetery.
I'm here to advise the stone maker
on his headstone.
Was he a goner fer' sure?
No chance he could be livin'
"the cold life" out in
the woods? It's a rough life,
but folks can learn it.
If he had done what he came here to do,
he'd a come home.
Close it, close it!
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut!
Really? Who's the idiot
who broke the damn door?
Fucking hold it low.
Okay.
Hold it, mi negro amigo.
We need two pieces of wood.
Ola mi cabron.
There you go, motherfucker!
- That's a lotta' hats, Senor Bob?
- Huh?
Considering Minnie's no
hats indoors policy? Which,
If I remember it correctly,
that was one of them Bar of Iron rules,
kinda rule,
she'd want kept up in her absence.
You seem to have a laissez faire
attitude when it comes to the hats.
I'm guilty.
I have a laissez faire
attitude about the hats.
How about we forget
about the hats today,
considering there's a
blizzard going on and all,
and make tomorrow "No Hat Day"?
A large black dog.
Labrador.
You know my daddy,
I said that my daddy!
Always said that Davis
was a courages man.
But he should have put capital
in Montgomery and not Richmond.
Yes, Sir. I agree with that the army in
North Virginia would've been used in a...
I said the army of North Virginia would
have been used in very different way.
Shut up!
O.B.?
Do you know that nigger, Sir?
I don't know that nigger.
But I know he's a nigger.
And that's all I need to know.
Well that nigger just ain't any nigger.
- That nigger is-
- General Sanford Smithers?
Battle of Baton Rouge?
Inform the nigger in the
Cavalry officers uniform
that I had a division
of Confederates under my commend,
in Baton Rouge.
Major Nigger, General Smithers wishes me to
inform you... I heard 'em hillbilly.
Inform this old cracker that
I was in Baton Rouge also.
On the other side.
Oh that's interesting.
General Smithers,
he said that he was also in Baton Rouge.
- On the other-
- Cap't Mannix, tell the nigger,
that I don't acknowledge
niggers in Northern uniforms.
You captured a whole
Colored Command that day.
But not one Colored Trooper
made it to a camp, did they?
We had neither the time or the food.
Nor the inclination
to care for Northern horses,
and least of all Northern niggers.
- So we shot 'em where they stood.
- Gentlemen,
Gentlemen,
I know Americans aren't apt
to let a little thing like an unconditional
surrender get in the way of a good war.
But I strongly suggest we don't restage
The Battle of Baton Rouge,
during a blizzard
in Minnie's Haberdashery.
Now, my Nubian friend,
while I realize passions are high,
that was a while ago.
And if you shoot this
un-armed old man I guarantee
I will hang you by the
neck until you are dead.
Once we arrive in Red Rock.
I damn will guarantee that too.
Yeah Warren,
that's the problem with old men.
You can kick 'em down
the stairs and say it's
a accident, but ya'
can't just shoot 'em.
Gentlemen, since we
may be trapped here,
close together like for a few days,
may I suggest a possible solution?
We divide Minnie's in half.
The Northern side
and The Southern Side.
With the dinner table
operating as a neutral territory.
We could say that the
fireplace side of the room,
acts as a symbolic representative of...
Georgia
While the bar, represents...
Philadelphia!
As long aas the bar's Philadelphia I agree.
We still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon?
I help you protect your eight thousand,
you help me protect my ten?
One of them fella's
is not what he says he is.
What is he?
He's in cahoots with this one
that's what he is.
One of them, maybe even two of 'em,
is here to see Domergue goes free.
And to accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everbody in here.
And they got 'em coupla' days.
So all they gotta' do
is sit tight and wait for
a winda' of opportunity.
And that's when they strike,
huh bitch?
If you say so, John.
Are you sure you're not
just being paranoid?
Our best bet is this,
duplicitous fella' ain't
as cool a customer as Daisy here.
He won't have the leather patience
it takes to just sit here and wait.
But waiting for an oportunity, and knowing
it's the right one, isn't so easy.
If he can't handle it, he'll stop waiting.
He'll try and create his opportunity.
And that's when Mr.Jumpy reveals himself.
And what do you got to say about all this?
What do I got to say?
About John Ruth's ravings?
He's absolutely right.
Me and one of them fella's
is in cahoots. And
we're just waitin' for
everybody go to sleep.
That's when we gonna' kill y'all.
Okay everybody,
hear this.
This here is Daisy Domergue.
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.
Ten thousand dollars.
That money's mine boys.
Don't wanna' share it.
I ain't gonna' lose it.
When the sun comes out, I'm taking
this woman into Red Rock, to hang.
Now...
is there anybody here...
comitted to stopping me...
from doing that?
Really?
Nobody gotta' problem with this?
Well, I guess that's
very fortunate for me.
However, I hope you
all understand,
I can't just take your word.
Circumstances force
me to, take...
precautions.
When you say precautions...
why do I feel you mean me?
- Because I'm gonna' take your gun, son.
- You are? - Yes I am.
- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?
The Hangman got
himself a gun too?
I'll be dealing with his
gun after I deal with yours.
I feel kinda' naked without it.
Oh, I still got mine.
I'll protect you.
A bastards work is never
done, huh, John Ruth?
That's right, Joe Gage.
- Now gimmie the gun.
- You want it?
You have to come and take-
Calm down.
Take your hand away from your gun.
Blink if you're calm.
- Did he blink?
- He blinked.
Blink if your gonna' remain calm?
- He blinked.
- Take his pistol.
I'm real sorry about this, son.
Like I said, nothing personal.
Just a precaution.
Pretty sneaky.
I'm afraid the same
applies to you too, Mr.
Mobray.
Precautions must be taken
because life is too sweet to lose.
Hand me that little bucket.
O.B.?
Go to the outhouse.
Take this bucket and dump
it down the shit hole.
Why do I gotta' go outside?
Your jacket's already on.
And I sorta kinda trust you.
After you Major.
Okay.
I'm gonna' cut you loose while we eat.
Don't get any ideas,
I ain't goin' soft on ya'.
You lift your ass even
one inch off this seat,
I'll put a bullet right
in your goddamn throat.
So Domergue,
I suppose this blizzard counts as a stroke
of luck as far as you're concerned?
- You don't hear me complaining do ya'?
- No I sure don't.
How 'bout you Oswaldo?
How about me what?
Look,
considerin' all the thing I done
for money, I ain't one to judge.
But don't you feel just the least
little bad 'bout hangin' a woman?
Till they invent a trigger
a woman can't pull, if
you're a hang man, you're
going to hang woman.
Well hell Ozzy, I guess I ain't never
looked at it like that before.
When it comes to some
of them mean bastards
out therem it's the only
thing does the job.
You really only need to hang mean bastards.
But mean bastards, you need to hang.
You goddamn son of a bitch!
I almost died out there!
I ain't never going out in that shit
ever, ever again!
You okay, O.B.?
I'm fine.
I'll be fine.
I just need to get warm.
You want some stew, O.B.?
Stew, later.
That's nice.
So...
- how you doin', black Major?
I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.
Leave me be from your horseshit.
John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln Letter?
I tole' you jackass to
Hee-Haw somewhere else.
That's right, John.
- You did say, didn't ya'?
- Yeah I did.
So...
- you got a letter from Abraham Lincoln?
- Yes.
Thee Abraham Lincoln?
Yes.
Abraham Lincoln The President
of the United States...
- Yes.
- Of America? - Yes.
- Wrote you a letter, personally?
- Yes.
- Personally? As in: "Dear Maj. Warren"?
- No. Personally as in: "Dear Marquis".
"Dear Marquis" Abraham Lincoln the
President of the United States of America?
Yes.
- May I see it?
- No you may not.
But the way John tells it,
you weren't just some
random nigger soldier picked
from a pile of letters.
Way John tells it,
- y'all hada' correspondence.
- Yes.
Way John tells it, y'all's
practically pen pals?
Yes.
And a pen pal's...
practically a friend.
John Ruth,
you really think a nigger
drummed outta' the
Calvary with a yellow
stripe down his back,
was practically friends with The President
of The United States of America?
John Ruth, I hate to be the one to break it
to ya' but nobody in Minnie's Haberdashery,
had ever corresponded with Abraham Lincoln,
Least of all, that nigger there.
Was all that horseshit?
Course it was.
Well I guess it's true
what they say about you people.
You can't trust a fuckin' word
that comes outta' your mouth.
What's the matter, John Ruth?
I hurt your feelings?
As a matter of fact, you did.
I know,
I'm the only black son of a bitch you ever
met, so I'm gonna' cut you some slack.
But you got no idea, what it's like
being a black man facin' down America.
The only time black folks are safe,
is when white folks is disarmed.
And this letter,
had the desired effect of
disarming white folks.
Call it what you want,
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.
You wanna' know why I'd lie
about something like that, white man?
Got me on that stagecoach, didn't it.
Well I'll tell you like
the lord tole' John,
a letter from Abraham Lincoln wouldn't
have that kinda' effect on me.
- I might let a whore piss on it.
- I spit on it.
Good for you, sister.
Warren goddamit,
you leave that old man alone!
Stand down you son of a bitch,
I shared a battle field with this man.
Or would you deny me that too?
I suppose you were there.
May I join you?
Yes you may.
Damn it.
So,
how's life since the war?
Got both my legs.
Got both my arms.
- I can't complain.
- Got a woman?
Fever took her, started this last winter.
What was her name?
- Betsy.
- Georgia girl?
Augusta.
Atlanta boy, and a Augusta girl.
I use to raise Kentucky horses.
Her paw' was the owner of the breedershit
where I brought of my ponies.
God damnit.
I made good deal on her.
Took the stake he gave and
bought a bunch peach ochards.
Set myself up pretty well.
Did a hellva' lot better than
my no good brothers, that's for damn sure.
Yeah, your son came up
here a few years back.
He spoke highly of his mama too.
You knew my boy?
Yeah...
Yeah I knew 'em.
You did not know my boy.
Suit yourself.
Didja' know my son?
I know the day he died, - do you?
- No.
You wanna know what day that was?
The day he met me.
He came up here to
do a little nigger head huntin'.
By then the reward was so,
five thousand and bragging rights.
But back then to battle hard rebs, five
thousand just to cut off a niggers head,
now that's good money.
So the Johnny's climbed this mountain,
lookin' for fortune.
But there was no fortune to be found.
All they found was me.
All them fella's came up
here sang a different tune,
when they found
themselves at the mercy of a nigger's gun,
"Let's just forget it.
I go my way, you go yours"
- that's your boy Chester talkin'
- You a goddamn lie.
"If you just let me
home to my family, I'll
swear, I'll never set
foot in Wyoming again."
That's what they all said.
Beggin' for his life.
Your boy told me his whole life story.
And you was in that story, General.
And when I knew me I had the son.
Of The Bloody Nigger
Killer of Baton Rouge...
- I knew me I was gonna' have some fun.
- You shut your lyin' nigger lips up!
General Smithers, don't you listen to him,
he didn't know your boy!
He just heard,
tell why you here is all!
It was cold the day I killed your boy.
And I don't mean snwoy mountain in
Wyoming cold. It was colder than that.
And on that cold day,
with your boy at the
business end of my gun barrel...
I made him strip.
Right down to his bare ass.
Then I told him to start walkin'.
I walked his naked ass for two hours,
'fore his cold collapsed him.
- You never even knew my boy?
- No he didn't!
He's just a sneaky nigger
tryin' to getcha to go for that gun!
Then he commits to begging again.
But this time he wasn't begging to go home.
He knew he'd never see his home again.
And he wasn't beggin' for his life neither.
'Cos he knew that was long gone.
All he wanted... was a blanket.
Now don't judge your boy
too harshly, General. You
ain't never been cold as
your boy was that day.
You'd be surprised what a man that cold,
would do for a blanket.
Wanna know what your boy did?
I took my big, black,
pecker outta' my pants.
And I made him crawl through
the snow on all fours over to it.
Then I grabbed a hand full
of that black hair on the back his head...
Then I stuck my big, black Johnson
right down his goddamn throat.
And it was fulla' blood, so it was warm.
You bet your sweet ass it was warm.
And Chester Charles Smithers,
sucked on that warm black dingus
for long as he could.
Starting to see pictures, ain't ya'?
Your boy...
black dudes dingus in his mouth.
Him shakin', him cryin'
me laughin'
and him not understandin'
But you understand, doncha' Sandy?
I never did give your boy that blanket.
Even after all he did,
and he did everything I asked.
No blanket.
That blanket was just
a heart breakin' liar's promise.
Kinda' like those uniforms
the union issued those colored troopers,
that you chose not to acknowledge.
So what you gonna' do old man?
You gonna' spend the
next two or three days,
ignore the nigger that killed your boy,
Ignoring how I made him suffer?
Ignoring how I made him...
lick, all over my Johnson?
The dumbest thing your boy ever did...
was to let me know...
he was your boy.
Chapter Four
Domergue's Got a Secret
About fifteen minutes has passed,
since we last left our characters.
Joe Gag volunteered
to take Smithers dead body outside.
Straws we drawn to see
who would help him...
O.B. lost.
Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo,
had vigorous debate about the legality of
self-defense murder they just transpired.
Marquis Warren who is
supremely confident about the
legality of what just
transpired, ignored them
sat at a table by himself
and drank brandy.
Captain Chris Mannix dawn
the dead Generals coat and
joined Oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.
Hey Ozzy,
hey you got the right idea.
Let's light this place up.
John Ruth held the door close,
waiting for Joe Gage and O.B. to return.
Bob enjoyed an manzana roja.
Domergue, however,
hasn't moved from her spot at the community
dinner table since John Ruth uncuffed her.
John Ruth...
Yeah?
Can I play that guitar over there?
Let's go back a bit.
Your boy, black dudes dingus in his mouth.
Fifteen minutes ago Major Warren shot
General Smithers in front of everybody.
But fourty seconds before
that, something equally
as important happened, but
not everybody saw it.
While Major Warren was
captivating the crowd
with tales of black dicks
and white mouths...
somebody... poisoned the coffy.
He did everything I asked, no blanket.
And the only one to see 'em do it...
was Domergue.
That's why this chapter is called...
Domergue's Got a Secret.
John Ruth.
Yeah.
Can I play that guitar over there?
Yeah.
You come back with anything
else but a guitar.
My pistol plays a tune.
Domergues death march, you got it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got it.
That's the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach, huh?
Yeah.
It's kinda' pretty.
- Got another verse to it?
- Yeah I got.
Go ahead, sing it.
Gimme that guitar!
Music time's over!
Turn around.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up!
When you get to hell, John.
Tell 'em Daisy sent ya'.
Mannix the coffy!
Oh my god!
Gimme that fucking gun!
Don't test me, bitch.
Everybody get your back sides up
against that back wall over yonder.
Goddamit-
Get or don't get, Joe Gage.
It's up to you.
- I'll get.
- Then get.
You too, Senor Bob.
Everybody turn around
and put your hands on that wall.
Move 'em down snowshoes.
Everybody keep your mouth
shut and do like I say.
You open your mouth; you
gonna' get a bullet.
You move a little sudden, a little strange;
you gonna' get a bullet.
Not a warning, not a question;
a bullet.
You got that?
- Let me hear you say, "I got it".
- "I got it".
- "I got it" - "I got it".
- We have it.
Chris Mannix,
come over here on this side.
Come on.
Take this gun out of my holster.
Point it at them.
Like I said, anybody does anything.
And I mean, anything.
Kill 'em.
So...
you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth
'bout bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?
I don't know 'bout all that.
But you ain't the killer
who poisoned that coffy.
'cos you almost drunk
it your own damn self.
But one of 'em is.
Gimme the key.
Gimme the key!
You motherfucking black bastard!
You're gonna' die on this mountain
and I'm gonna' fucking laugh when you do!
What I say 'bout talkin?
'Meant it, didn't I?
And you need to understand,
you just killed the only
man here, comitted to gettin'
you to Red Rock alive.
Now, one of y'all...
is workin' with her.
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.
Or all y'all is...
but only one of you poisoned the coffy.
So what charms this bitch got,
take a man brave a blizzard,
kill in cold blood, I'm
sure I don't know.
But John Ruth's trying to hang your woman,
so you kill him... okay- maybe.
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.
He damn sure would.
But he sure enough led over there
dead now, though, ain't he?
He damn sure is you
sons of bitches.
Just like any one of us
who'd drank that coffy.
Like me god damnit.
Now those of y'all with
your hands on the wall
don't practice in poison
need to think about that.
Think about how that coulda' you
been you rollin' around on this floor.
And about the men standin' next
ta' ya' would be responsible.
And I know who I got my money on. Yeah
that's right Joe Gage I'm lookin' at you.
Not so fast Chris.
We'll get there.
Let's slow it down.
Let's slow it way down.
Who made the coffy?
He did.
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did, didn't he?
But it's the stew that's got me thinking.
How long you say Minnie been gone?
A week?
Si.
See, my mama used to make stew.
And it always tasted the same,
no matter the meat.
And there was another fellow
on the plantation, Uncle Charly.
He made stew too
and like my mama's.
I ate his stew from the
time I was a whipper,
to I was a full grown man.
And no matter the meat,
it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.
Now I ain't had Minnie's stew in six
months, so I ain't no expert, but that,
damn sure is Minnie's stew.
So if Minnie's on the north side
visiting her mama for a week,
how'd she make the stew this morning?
And this?
This... is Sweet Dave's chair.
When I sat in it earlier,
I couldn't belive it.
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chaire.
This may be Minnie's place,
but this is damn sure,
Sweet Dave's chair.
And if... he went to
the north side....
I'm pretty goddamn sure
that chair's be going with him.
What's in the chair?
Just what I thought.
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.
So...
are you actually accusing me of murder?
The way I see it, Senior Bob,
whoever's workin' with her,
ain't who they say they is.
And if it's you,
that means Minnie
and her man ain't at her mama's.
They're lyin' out back
there dead somewhere.
Or if it's you Britisch Man,
the real Oswaldo Mobray is lyin'
in a ditch somewhere. And
you're just an English fella'
passin' off his papers.
Or we go by my theory, which
is the ugliest guy did it.
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.
So I take it you've
deduced the coffy was
poisoned while you were
murdering the old man?
Yes.
Well, mi negro amigo,
during that whole incident...
I was sitting on that side of the room.
Playing Silent Night on the piano.
I didn't say you poisoned the coffy.
I said you didn't make the stew.
My theory is...
you're working with man
who poisoned the coffy.
And both of y'all murdered Minnie,
and Sweet Dave and whoever
else picked this bad luck
day to visit Minnie's
Haberdashery this morning.
And at some point, y'all intented
to bushwhack John Ruth and free Daisy.
But you didn't count on the blizzard
and you didn't count on the two of us.
That's as far as I got.
How am I doin'?
Your a real imaginative nigger, ain't you?
So, do you intend to murder me
based on a far fetched nigger theory?
Or can you prove it, cabrone?
It ain't so far fetched, Senior Bob.
And it's a little bit more then my theory.
How long you say you been
working for Minnie's?
Four months.
If you would have been here
two and half years ago
you'd know about the sign
usta' hang above the bar.
- Minnie mentioned that to you?
- No.
You know what that sign said, Senior Bob?
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed"
Minnie hung that sign up the
day she opened this Habadashery.
And it hung over that
Bar every day till she
took down, a little
over two years ago.
You know why she took it down?
She started lettin' in dogs.
Now Minnie likes just about everybody,
but she sure don't like Mexicans.
So when you tell me, Minnie went
to North side to visit her mama?
Well I find that highly
unlikely... but okay - maybe.
But when you tell me Minnie
Mink took The Habadashery,
the most precious thing to
her in the whole world,
and left it in hands of a Goddamn Mexican?
Well that's what I meant in the barn when I
said:
Now I am calling you a liar, Senior Bob.
And if you lyin, which you are,
then you killed Minnie -
and Sweet Dave.
Four measly bulltes and
there goes Senior, Bob.
That still don't get us no closer...
to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffy, though.
- Does it Chris?
- No it sure don't.
Now one of y'all poisoned this coffy,
to free Daisy.
If I don't hear a
confession from one of you
motherfuckers quick,
fast and in a hurry,
I'm gonna' pull this whole pot of coffy,
down that bitches goddamn throat.
Okay, time's up.
Stop! Alright I did it,
it was me I poisoned the coffy.
I fuckin' knew it!
You gonna' die now you murderin' bastard.
Major Warren please let me
sent this ugly son of a bitch to hell.
You killed O.B. he's worth ten of you!
Warren can I kill him?
Say adios to your Huevos.
Major Warren?
I ain't got no gun, sheriff.
Chapter Five The Four Passengers
Earlier That Morning.
- Hey Charly my, how the hell are you?
- Hi ya' Ed, hi ya' Judy-
- How many ya' got?
- Full house today, friend.
We got on in there waiting.
Well he's gonna' hafta keep on
waitin' cause we ain't got no room.
Well you need to tell Minnie.
Cause he's been
here two days and Minnie
wants him outta here.
Well I can't give him a seat I don't have -
Listen why don't you take the passengers
inside, introduce them to Minnie.
- Warm youself up and drink some coffy.
- Okay.
Here we are everybody,
Minnie's Haberdashery.
Step outside you and
your friends can stretch
your legs. When you're
reday, stop on inside,
get warm by the fire, get some coffy
in you. I'll introduve you to Minnie.
Hi Minnie!
I'm not trying to tell
you how to run your business.
But I would think coffy
would be the first thing you'd make.
- Come on in everybody, don't be shy.
- Hats!
Everybody, this is Minnie,
and this is her place.
Behind me pluckin' that chicken is Gemma.
Lovley smile, that Gemma.
Now the fella' in the
uniform I don't know but
the one he's playing chess
with is Sweet Dave.
- Hi ya' Dave.
- Hey Judy.
And Minnie, these are the passengers.
Well that's not good enough.
Go take away them rags,
let's see some faces let's hear some names.
Oswaldo Mobray, madame.
Joe Gage.
Bob.
And I'm Jody.
It's a pleasant surprise
to find such a warm
sanctuary in the middle
of such a cold hell.
Well make yourself comfortable.
Get warm by the fire.
We're just gonna' go warm ourself's
by the stove, if that's all right?
Stove, fireplace, whatever.
Just get warm.
Oh, and Judy said something
about the best coffy in the world?
Yes I do belive Judy did say something
about the best coffy in the world.
Well I don't know 'bout all that.
But I'll tell ya what it is.
It's hot and it's strong
and it's good. And
in this snow it sure
'nuff warms your ass up.
You don't need to sell it,
Minnie, you need make it.
And you need to get
your ass out there and
help Charly with them
bags and get Ed in here.
- Yes, ma'am, but fix the coffy.
- I'll fix you!
I don't know some old man.
Well I don't know what I'm
suppose to do about it.
I'm just tellin' you what she said.
Anyway she sent me out here
to help Charly, she wants to talk to you.
Got 'em, Ed.
Miss Minnie?
Would you roll me a cigarette?
Sure honey,
I smoke Red Apple Tobacco, that all right?
It's my favorite.
Don't mind me gentlemen,
I'm just watching.
You play?
You know,
I must of had at least twelve people,
teach me that goddamn game.
Just never could keep the moves in my head.
But if I'm not disturbing,
I like to watch?
Hell no. I like whippin' this
old man's ass in front of a audience,
You ain't whippin' shit.
Merci beaucoup Mademoiselle, Minnie.
- Oh that's real nice, what is that?
- It's french.
- You speak french?
- Oui-
- Oui - what is that mean?
- It means yes.
Oui - Yes.
- Hey Dave, ask me if my ass is fat.
- What?
- Ask me if my ass is fat?
- It is.
- I said ask me!
- Why?
- Just do it!
- Is your ass fat?
Oui, look at that y'all
I can speak French.
Are you the jelly bean
salesman around here?
How many peppermint
sticks I get for a nickel?
Five.
All right.
- Here.
- Thank you sugar.
Okay.
Allow me to assist you, madame.
I brought in your bags
in case anybody wants
to change your clothes
before Red Rock.
Peppermint stick?
Thanks.
So why do they call you
Six Horse Judy anyway?
Cause I'm the only Judy you've ever seen
that could drive a six horse team?
Hell yeah, kinda of a stupid question.
- Could you holding this for me?
- Rock steady, madame. Rock steady.
You gotta' very sweet accent,
where that from, England?
- I take exception to that!
- New Zeeland.
- Carefull, madame.
- Is it anywhere near Old Zealand?
Auckland, what the
fuck is an Auckland?
It's where I'm from,
it's our biggest city.
- Coffy's ready!
- It's about damn time.
- Best coffy on the mountain.
- I'll don't know 'bout all that.
Stagecoach drivers like it. Passengers,
not so much.
Most find it a
mite too strong.
Can't be too strong on
this mountain, thank you.
Well, what'd ya' think?
Shit!
He adds something,
not much, but something.
What do you think, Pete?
Well I must admit, he does make
the set up more convincing.
Do we collect the bodies
and chuck 'em in the well out there?
And then start unhitching the horses
and get 'em in the barn and get 'em fed.
Well hang on, by puttin the
horses away that's easy enough.
To drag these fat bastards up and down the
mountain that's fucking impossible, mate.
Look I just started working here.
Whatever Minnie to make y'all mad.
I had nothing to do with it.
Well old man,
if you was a cat what
just happened here
would count as one of your nine lives.
You realize how close you came to being
tossed on a pile of niggers?
- Yes. And when it comes to that pile
of niggers we building out back,
won't take nothin' to make you
General of it. You believe that?
- I expect no less.
- Not so fast old man.
You might have a way out of this yet.
Later today,
dirty son of a gun's gonna come in here.
And he's gonna have my sister with him,
and he's gonna have her in chains.
He's taking her into Red Rock to be hung.
- You know why?
- No.
Ten thousand dollars.
That's why.
And when he get's here.
I'm gonna' kill that fella'
and turn my sister lose.
Now do you have any reason
why you'd want to interfere
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?
- No.
- You don't.
- No I don't.
- You sure you don't.
I mean we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.
You and Sweet Dave
seemed pretty chummy over here.
I just met these people. I don't give a
damn about them, or you, or your sister,
or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming for that matter.
That is a good answer, old man.
So when they get here,
you just sit your ass in this chair.
And you don't do nothin'.
You don't say nothin'. Hello, thank
you, good night, that's about it.
Maybe your name, but that's it.
Hello, thank you, good night and...
- Maybe your name.
- Maybe my name.
Be an old man, be dotty.
Go to sleep.
And don't you say nothin'
and I mean nothin'
to that bounty hunter
that's got my sister.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
When it's safe I kill him,
free my sister and leave you be.
Deal?
Deal, thank you.
During the next four hours, Jody and the
boys chuck the bodies down the well.
Put away the horses.
Tidied around Minnie's.
Stash weapons for further use.
And waited for John Ruth
and Daisy's Stage to arrive.
Here they come.
Okay boys, this is it, get ready!
Let's get ready.
Now remember, it dosen't matter
if we have four men or fory,
we're still gonna' be
facing John Ruth chained
to my sister with a pistol
pointed at her belly.
Now killin' that fella' 'fore he
kills my sister, ain't gonna' be easy.
But you believe that's
exactly what we're gonna do.
So the name of the game here is patience.
Trapped here for two or three days,
at some point, he will close his eyes
and that's when you
blow the top of his head off.
Remember old man, my sister don't make it
off this mountain alive, neither do you.
I'll do my best.
Good luck, mate.
What the hell's going on,
we weren't expecting another stage tonight?
I can see
you already got another one up in here.
I just got through putting the horses away.
This ain't the normal line. But we are
stuck on the wrong side of a blizzard,
so it looks like you're stuck with us.
I can do another one.
And Sweet Dave inside?
They ain't here.
I'm running the place while they're gone.
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?
He says they ain't here. He's lookin'
after the place while they gone.
- Who are you?
- I'm Bob.
Well whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.
Get 'em outta this cold,
before that blizzard hit's 'em.
I just put those other horses away.
You need it done fast, you need to help.
I got two of my best men on it.
You heard him freeloaders,
get to work.
Come on let's go!
- Open up!
- You have to kick it open! - What?
Kick it open!
Last Chapter
Black Man, White Hell
How you doin' old boy?
They shot my nuts off they're freezin'
burining up the same time,
bleedin like a stuck pig.
I think I'm gonna die.
And these motherfuckers did it.
That's how I'm doin'.
How you doin'?
Well my leg hurts really bad.
But I think if I'm put all
my weight on my right foot-
I'm just bein' sarcastic
I don't give a fuck about your leg.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Don't worry about my comfort.
Shit! I can't feel my ass no more.
Worry about these owl hoots and that
bushwhacker nuts shooter in the basement.
All right!
You!
Fella' in the basement!
You either give up by the
time I count to three,
or I shoot Domergue in the head.
One!... Two!...
No, no, no, no! Don't shoot her!
I'm comin' up!
Hold on there you bushwhacker
sack shooter, you
just open the door we
tell you to come up!
Now throw out your pistol!
Throw it to the bed.
Well he got another.
Now throw out your other pistol.
I ain't got another pistol!
Well you better shit
another pistol out your ass!
Cause if you don't throw one up here in the
next two seconds we gonna' kill this bitch!
See? told ya'.
Now...
with your hands where we can see 'em...
slowly come on up!
How ya' doin' dummy?
Better now I see your ugly face.
How you like you that?
You bushwhacker castrator!
What are you doin' he was giving up?
It took him too long so I done for him.
Joe Gage get your
ass over and shut this trap door.
I'm sorry, honey.
May I sit in the chair?
Yes you may.
Keep your hands flat on that table.
And don't move 'em.
Mannix!
You sure picked the wrong time to turn
into a nigger lover.
Don't you see that nigger and John Ruth
put you smack dab in the middle of danger?
You're about to be murdered
in some nigger named
Minnie's house and you
don't even know why!
Okay, bitch...
I'll bite... why?
I am workin with all
three of them fella's...
but not cause they got
butterflies in their belly 'bout me.
But because we're all gang members,
The Jody Domergue Gang!
That fella' y'all just killed in the
basement, was Jody Domergue, my brother!
Well who the hell,
is Jody Domergue?
You wanna tell 'em bounty man?
He's a big bad cat.
He's worth fifty thousand dollars.
And every member of his
gang is wort at least ten.
Wich finally explains why you're worth ten.
And what's gonna' happen
when that sun comes
out nigger, so is my
brother's fifteen men
comin' straight here for us!
Tell 'em Grouch!
Jody's got fifteen men waitin' in Red Rock.
If we couldn't kill John
Ruth and free Daisy here.
Their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth and free Daisy there.
Now with brohter deadd,
I'm in charge of this gang, right boys?
Oh yeah.
And Chris I'm tellin' you, you ain't
done anything yet, we can't forgive.
So...
- let's make a deal?
- No deals, bitch!
You gonna' let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?
Hold it Warren.
Seein' as she ain't got
nothin' to sell, I'm
kinda curious about her
sales pitch, humor me.
All right, bitch.
What's... your... deal?
Easy.
Take your gun, shoot
that nigger dead.
Then we sit here all nice like
for the next two days.
When the snow melts...
we go back to Mexico and you go on to Red
Rock to get that star pinned on your chest.
Well... we can give 'em Marco.
Bob's real name is
"Marco The Mexican".
He's worth twelve thousand dollars.
- That's "Marco The Mexican"?
- Precisely, yeah.
Sheeit, after I blew his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.
If I die in the next two days, which
is more than likely, you can have me.
Under the name "English Pete
Hicox" I've gotta' federal
bounty of fifteen thousand
dollars on my head.
- And it's all your Chris.
- You keep talkin', Pete.
You gonna talk yourself to death.
Joe Gage, who you be?
- Grouch Douglass.
- You heard of him?
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.
He's worth ten, just like Daisy.
Remind me,
why we wouldn't just kill
all y'all and cash in?
Oh, you can kill us all. But you'll
never spend a cent of that bounty money
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.
Because when that snow
melts, the rest of Jody's
gang - all fifteen of 'em
- that were waiting,
in Red Rock are comin' here.
Now let, let's say you shoot us all...
If you really want all that
Domergue Gang bounty money,
you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.
And that ain't gonna' be so easy. Cause I
doubt you can drive a four horse team.
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two horse team.
So that means you're gonna' hafta'
lead a string of horses into Red Rock
And with that deep snow after a blizzard,
you ain't gonna' be able to get away with
any more then let's say one body per horse.
So that's you, leading a string of
four horses into Red Rock,
and with all them horses, in that snow,
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.
And you gonna' run smack
dab into The Domergue
Gang and agin Grouch,
how many is that?
- Fifteen killer strong.
- And when those fifteen killers,
come across you,
in possession of all of
our dead bodies, they
ain't just gonna' kill
you and that nigger.
There gonna go back to Red Rock
and kill every son of a bitch in that town.
You really the Sheriff of Red Rock?
You wanna save the town?
Then shoot that nigger dead!
You belive in Jesus now, huh, bitch?
Well good 'cos 'bout meet him!
Anybody else wanna' make a deal, huh?
The deal still stands, Chris.
You ain't done we can't forgive.
It's still all on that nigger.
Shoot 'em dead, take my body
and sit out the snow with Daisy and Grou-
Mannix!
Give me my pistol!
Catch 'em here.
Catch 'em here.
So...
you were sayin'...
we sit here...
all nice and friendly like...
for the next two days...
then the snow melts,
you leave here, meet up
with your gang and high tail it to Mexico?
Yeah.
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?
Yeah.
But Jody's worth fifty thousand,
what 'bout his body?
You gonna make a deal with
this diabolical bitch?
I'm not sayin' I'm gonna' make a deal
with her, we're just talkin'. Calm down.
So what about Jody's body
and the fifty thousand?
You've gotten greedy, Reb, no deal.
We take Jody's body back with us
he got children.
So I kill, Warren...
and we're all friends?
Yeah.
No deal, tramp.
Chris you're makin' the biggest
mistake of your life!
When our boys get here in a coupla' days,
their gonna cut your nuts off!
And there won't be a
stick left in that town unburnt.
Well I guess I should be
plum scared right now, huh?
If you had any brains, you would be.
You see...
here's the problem Daisy.
In order for me to be
scared of your threats,
I got to believe in those fifteen extra
gang members waitin' it out in Red Rock.
And boy, oh boy... I sure don't.
What I belive is...
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass
whatever the fuck his name was....
poisoned the coffy...
and you watched him do it.
And you watched me pork up
and didn't say shit...
and I believe...
you all what you've always been...
a lyin' bitch,
who will do anything...
to cheat that rope waitin'
for her in Red Rock.
Including shittin' out
fifteen extra gang members,
Whenever you needs be.
And...
I believe when it comes to what's left of
The Jody Doe-ming-grey Gang...
I'm lookin' at 'em,
right here right, right
now. Dead on this on this
motherfuckin' floor.
Goddamn right.
You're gonna' die on
this mountain, Chris.
- My brother leds an army of men-
- Horse Shit!
My daddy led an army, he led a
renegade amry, fightin' a lost cause!
My daddy held up to
four hundred men together after the war
with nothing but
their respect in his command.
Your brother's just a owl hoot
who led a gang of killers.
I don't feel so good.
Oh, shit.
You still alive, white boy?
Mannix?
Fuck!
Hey, boy!
Get up!
Chris Mannix!
Your ass ain't nailed to the floor!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake up, white boy!
I ain't dead yet, you black bastard.
Chris Mannix,
I may have misjudged you.
Now we've come to the part of the story...
- where I blow your goddamn head off!
- No, no, no don't shoot her!
Why the hell not?
John Ruth.
John Ruth was one mighty, mighty bastard.
What's the las thing...
that bastard did, 'fore he died?
Was save your life.
We gonna' die, white boy.
We ain't got no say in that.
But there's one thing left
we do have a say in.
And that how we kill this bitich.
And I say, shootin's to good for her...
John Ruth coulda shot her anywhere,
anytime along the way,
but John Ruth was The Hangman...
and when The Hangman catches ya',
you don't die by no bullet.
When the The Hangman catches ya'...
you hang.
"You only need to hang Mean Bastards."
"But Mean Bastards, you need to hang".
As my first and final act
as the Sheriff of Red Rock,
I sentence you, Domergue,
to hang by the neck until dead.
Hang on, Daisy.
I wanna watch.
Now that, was a nice dance.
That sure was pretty.
Hey...
can I see that Lincoln Letter?
Dear Marquis...
I hope this letter finds you...
in good health and stat...
I'm doing fine...
altough I whish
there were more hours in the day....
is just so much to do...
time's changing slowly...
but surely...
and it's men like you
that will make a difference...
your military success was a credit...
not only to you... but
your race aswell...
I'm very proud
everytime I hear new of you...
we still have a long way to go,
but hand in hand...
I know we'll get there...
I just want to let you know,
you're in my thoughts...
hopefully our paths will
cross in the future...
until then... I
remain your friend...
ole' Mary Todd's calling...
so I guess it must be time for bed...
respectfully... Abraham Lincoln.
Ole' Mary Todd...
That's a nice touch.
Yeah... Thanks.
Creator:
Happy X-Mas, y'all.

FADE IN:

EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
French call cow country).
We read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farmhouse:

CHAPTER ONE

"ONCE UPON A TIME IN . . .

NAZI-OCCUPIED FRANCE"
This SUBTITLE disappears and is replaced by another one:

"1941
One year into the German
occupation of France"
The farm consists of a house, a small barn, and twelve cows spread
about.
The owner of the property, a bull of a man, FRENCH FARMER, brings
an ax up and down on a tree stump, blemishing his property.
However, simply by sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at
this stump for the last year or just started today.

JULIE
one of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging laundry on
the clothesline. As she hangs up a white bedsheet, she hears a
noise. Moving the sheet aside, she sees:

JULIE'S POV
A Nazi town car convertible, with two little Nazi flags attached to
the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in
the backseat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles,
coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

JULIE
Pappa.
The French farmer sinks his ax in the stump, looks over his
shoulder, and sees the Germans approaching.
The FARMER'S WIFE, CHARLOTTE, comes to the doorway of their home,
followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and sees the Germans
approaching.
The farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FARMER
Go back inside and shut the door.

FARMER
(to Julie)
Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash
up with, then get inside with your mother.
The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
basin and begins pumping. After a few pumps, water comes out,
splashing into the basin.
The French farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from his
face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for a
year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
very well be the end.
Julie finishes filling the water basin and places it on the
windowsill.

JULIE
Ready, Pappa.

FARMER
Thank you, darling, now go inside and take care
of your mother. Don't run.
Julie walks inside the farmhouse and closes the door behind her.
As her father stands up from the stump and moves over to the
windowsill with the water basin . . .
. . . The SOUND OF THE ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get

LOUDER.
The farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
front. He takes a towel off a nail and wipes the excess water from
his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
Party come to a halt on his property.
We don't move into them but keep observing them from a distance,
like the farmer.
The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLISTS are off their bikes and standing at
attention next to them.
The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile and opened the
door for his superior.
The NAZI OFFICER says to the driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN:

NAZI OFFICER
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

NAZI DRIVER
Yes, Herr Colonel.
The Nazi officer climbs out of the backseat of the vehicle,
carrying in his left hand a black leather attache case.

NAZI OFFICER
Herrman, until I summon you, I am to be left
alone.

NAZI DRIVER
As you wish, Herr Colonel.
The S.S. colonel yells to the farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN

ENGLISH:

NAZI OFFICER
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

FARMER
I am Perrier LaPadite.
The S.S. colonel crosses the distance between them with long
strides and says, in French, with a smile on his face:

NAZI OFFICER
It is a pleasure to meet you, Monsieur
LaPadite. I am Colonel Hans Landa of
the S.S.
COL. HANS LANDA offers the French farmer, PERRIER LAPADITE, his
hand. The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

PERRIER
How may I help you?

COL. LANDA
I was hoping you could invite me inside your
home and we may have a discussion.

INT—LAPADITE FARMHOUSE—DAY
The door to the farmhouse swings open, and the farmer gestures for
the S.S. colonel to enter. Removing his gray S.S. cap, the German
steps inside the Frenchman's home.
Col. Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the farmer's
wife and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen,
smiling in his direction.
The farmer enters behind him, closing the door.

PERRIER
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
The S.S. colonel clicks his heels together and takes the hand of
the French farmer's wife . . .

COL. LANDA
Col. Hans Landa of the S.S., Madame,
at your service.
He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his
hostess's hand . . .

COL. LANDA
Please excuse my rude intrusion on your
routine.

FARMER'S WIFE
Don't be ridiculous, Herr Colonel.
While still holding the French woman's hand and looking into her
eyes, the S.S. colonel says:

COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in
the village about your family are all true.
Your wife is a beautiful woman.
His eyes leave the mother and move to the three daughters.

COL. LANDA

(CON'T)
And each of your daughters is more lovely than
the last.

PERRIER
Merci. Please have a seat.
The farmer offers the S.S. colonel a seat at the family's wooden
dinner table. The Nazi officer accepts the French farmer's offer
and lowers himself into the chair, placing his gray S.S. cap on the
table and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his feet.
The farmer (perfect host) turns to his wife and says:

PERRIER
Charlotte, would you be so good as to get the
Colonel some wine?

COL. LANDA
Merci beaucoup, Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine.
This being a dairy farm, one would be safe in
assuming you have milk?

CHARLOTTE
Oui.

COL. LANDA
Then milk is what I prefer.

CHARLOTTE
Very well.
The mother of three takes a carafe of milk out of the icebox
and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for the colonel.
The S.S. colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it
down LOUDLY on the wooden table.

COL. LANDA
Monsieur, to both your family and your cows I
say: Bravo.

PERRIER
Merci.

COL. LANDA
Please, join me at your table.

PERRIER
Very well.
The French farmer sits at his wooden dinner table across from
the Nazi.
The women remain standing.
Col. Landa leans forward and says to the farmer in a low tone of
confidentiality:

COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss
would be better discussed in private. You'll
notice, I left my men outdoors. If it wouldn't
offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies
to step outside?

PERRIER
You are right.

PERRIER
(to his women)
Charlotte, would you take the girls outside.
The Colonel and I need to have a few words.
The farmer's wife follows her husband's orders and gathers her
daughters, taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
The two men are alone at the farmer's dinner table, in the farmer's
humble home.

COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I've
exhausted the extent of my French. To continue
to speak it so inadequately would only serve to
embarrass me. However, I've been led
to believe you speak English quite well?

PERRIER
Oui.

COL. LANDA
Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This
being your house, I ask your permission to
switch to English for the remainder of the
conversation.

PERRIER
By all means.
They now speak ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very familiar with
you and your family,
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar
with who I am. Are you aware
of my existence?
The farmer answers:

PERRIER
Yes.

COL. LANDA
This is good. Are you aware of the job I've
been ordered to carry out in France?

PERRIER
Yes.
The colonel drinks more milk.

COL. LANDA
Please tell me what you've heard?

PERRIER
I've heard the Fuhrer has put you in charge of
rounding up the Jews left in France who are
either hiding or passing for gentile.
The S.S. colonel smiles.

COL. LANDA
The Fuhrer couldn't have said it better
himself.

PERRIER
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though
it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine months
ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.

COL. LANDA
I'm aware of that. I read the report on this
area. But like any enterprise,
when under new management, there's always a
slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being
a complete waste of time, but it needs to be
done nevertheless.
I just have a few questions, Monsieur LaPadite.
If you can assist me with answers, my
department can close the
file on your family.
Taking his black leather attache case and placing it on the table,
he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts an expensive
black fountain pen from his uniform's front pocket. Opening the
folder and referring to it:

COL. LANDA
Now, before the occupation there were four
Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers
like yourself:
the Loveitts, the Doleracs, the Rollins,
and the Dreyfuses, is that correct?

PERRIER
To my knowledge those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.
Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if
I smoked my pipe?
Looking up from his papers:

COL. LANDA
Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house.
Make yourself comfortable.
The farmer gets up from the table, goes to a shelf over the
fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
fixings to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
guest.
As the farmer loads the bowl of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S.
colonel studies the papers in front of him.

COL. LANDA
Now, according to these papers, all
the Jewish families in this area have been
accounted for—except the Dreyfuses. Somewhere in
the last year it would appear they have
vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that they've
either made good their escape
or someone is very successful hiding them.
(looking up from
his papers, across
the table at the
farmer)
What have you heard about the Dreyfuses,
Monsieur LaPadite?

PERRIER
Only rumors—

COL. LANDA
—I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where
rumors, true or false, are often revealing. So,
Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard
regarding
the Dreyfuses?
The farmer looks at Landa.

COL. LANDA
Speak freely, Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear
what the rumors are, not who told them to you.
The farmer puffs thoroughly on his pipe.

PERRIER
Again, this is just a rumor—but we
heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into
Spain.

COL. LANDA
So the rumors you've heard have been of escape?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL. LANDA
Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfuses friendly?
As the farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
floorboards, revealing:

FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
lying horizontally underneath the farmer's floorboards. These human
beings are the DREYFUSES, who have lived lying down underneath the
dairy farmer's house for the past year. But one couldn't call what
the Dreyfuses have done for the last year living. This family has
done the only thing they could—hide from an occupying army that
wishes to exterminate them.

PERRIER
We were families in the same community, in the
same business. I wouldn't say
we were friends, but members of the same
community. We had common interests.
The S.S. colonel takes in this answer, seems to accept it, then
moves to the next question.

COL. LANDA
Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you
confirm for me the exact members of the
household and their names?

PERRIER
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob . . . wife, Miriam . . . her
brother, Bob . . .

COL. LANDA
—How old is Bob?

PERRIER
Thirty—thirty-one?

COL. LANDA
Continue.

PERRIER
And the children . . . Amos . . . and Shosanna.

COL. LANDA
Ages of the children?

PERRIER
Amos—six—I believe. And Shosanna
was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really sure.

CUT TO

EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The mother and her three daughters finish taking the laundry off
the clothesline.
They can't hear anything going on inside.
The three Nazi soldiers watch the three daughters.

BACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER

COL. LANDA
Well, I guess that should do it.
He begins gathering up his papers and putting them back into his
attache case.
The farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.

COL. LANDA
However, before I go, could I have another glass
of your delicious milk?

PERRIER
But of course.
The farmer stands up, goes over to the icebox, and takes out the
carafe of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi colonel's
glass, the German officer talks.

COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
nickname the people of France have given me?

PERRIER
I have no interest in such things.

COL. LANDA
But you are aware of what they call me?

PERRIER
I'm aware.

COL. LANDA
What are you aware of?

PERRIER
That they call you "the Jew Hunter."

COL. LANDA
Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in
repeating it.
Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
apparently hated the moniker the good people of
Prague bestowed on him. Actually, why he would
hate the name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.
It would appear he did everything in
his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title, precisely because
I've earned it.
As "the Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
with the French farmer.

COL. LANDA
The feature that makes me such an effective
hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German
soldiers, I can think like a Jew, where they can
only think like a German or, more precisely, a
German soldier.
Now if one were to determine what attribute the
German people share with a beast, it would be the
cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk.

COL. LANDA

(CON'T)
Negroes—gorillas—brain—lips—smell—physical
strength—penis size.
But if one were to determine what attributes
the Jews share with a beast, it would
be that of the rat.
Now the Fuhrer and Goebbels's propaganda have
said pretty much the same thing. Where our
conclusions differ is I don't consider the
comparison an insult. Consider for a moment the
world a rat lives in. It's a hostile world
indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your
front door right now, would you greet it with
hostility?

PERRIER
I suppose I would.

COL. LANDA
Has a rat ever done anything to you to create
this animosity you feel toward them?

PERRIER
Rats spread disease, they bite people—

COL. LANDA
Unless some fool is stupid enough to
try and handle a live one, rats don't make it a
practice of biting human beings. Rats were the
cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some
time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever
caused you to be sick a day in your life? I
propose to you, any disease a rat could spread
a squirrel would equally carry.
Yet I assume you don't share the same animosity
with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?

PERRIER
No.

COL. LANDA
Yet they are both rodents, are they
not? And except for the fact that one has a big
bushy tail, while the other has a long
repugnant tail of rodent skin, they even rather
look alike, don't they?

PERRIER
It is an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.

COL. LANDA
However, interesting as the thought may be, it
makes not one bit of difference to how you
feel. If a rat were to scamper through your
door this very minute, would you offer it a
saucer of your delicious milk?

PERRIER
Probably not.

COL. LANDA
I didn't think so. You don't like them. You
don't really know why you don't like them. All
you know is, you find them repulsive.
(lets the
metaphor
sink in)
What a tremendously hostile world a rat must
endure. Yet not only does he survive, he
thrives. And the reason for this is because our
little foe has an instinct for survival and
preservation second to none. And that, Monsieur,
is what a Jew shares with a rat.
Consequently, a German soldier conducts
a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn,
he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar—he looks everywhere he
would hide. But there are many places it would
never occur to a hawk to hide. However, the
reason the Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in
Austria and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.
Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human
beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
(changing tone)
May I smoke my pipe as well?
The farmer's cool facade is little by little eroding.

PERRIER
Please, colonel, make yourself at home.
The Jew Hunter removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.
The pipe, strangely enough, is a calabash, made from an S-shaped
gourd with a yellow skin and made famous by Sherlock Holmes.
As the Nazi colonel busies himself with his smoking, he continues
to hold court at the Frenchman's table.

COL. LANDA
The other mistake the German soldiers
make is their severe handling of the
citizens who give shelter and aid to
the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
of the state. They are simply confused
people, trying to make some sense out of
the madness war creates.
These citizens do not need punishing.
They simply need to be reminded of their
duty in wartime.
Let's use you as a example, Monsieur
LaPadite. In this war, you have found
yourself in the middle of a conflict
that has nothing to do with yourself,
your lovely ladies, or your cows—yet
here you are.
So, Monsieur LaPadite, let me propose
a question. In this time of war, what is
your number-one duty? Is it to fight
the Germans in the name of France to your
last breath? Or is it to harass the
occupying army to the best of your
ability? Or is it to protect the poor, unfortunate
victims of warfare who can
not protect themselves?
Or is your number-one duty in this time
of bloodshed to protect those very
beautiful women who constitute your
family?
The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

COL. LANDA
That was a question, Monsieur LaPadite. In this
time of war, what do you consider your number-
one duty?

PERRIER
To protect my family.

COL. LANDA
Now, my job dictates that I must have
my men enter your home and conduct a thorough
search before I can officially cross your
family's name off my list.

COL. LANDA

(CON'T)
And if there are any irregularities to be
found, rest assured, they will be.
That is, unless you have something to tell me
that will make the conducting of a search
unnecessary.
(pause)
I might add also that any information
that makes the performing of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.
Actually quite the contrary, it will be
met with reward.
And that reward will be your family
will cease to be harassed in any way
by the German military during the rest of our
occupation of your country.
The farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German
opponent.

COL. LANDA
You are sheltering enemies of the state, are
you not?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL. LANDA
You're sheltering them underneath your
floorboards, aren't you?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL. LANDA
Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
The farmer points out the areas on the floor where the Dreyfuses
are underneath.

COL. LANDA
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume that while they're listening, they
don't speak English?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL. LANDA
I'm going to switch back to French now, and I
want you to follow my masquerade—is that clear?

PERRIER
Yes.
Col. Landa stands up from the table and, switching to FRENCH, says,

SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I thank you for your milk and
your hospitality. I do believe our business here
is done.
The Nazi officer opens the front door and silently motions for his
men to approach the house.

COL. LANDA
Madame LaPadite, I thank you for your time. We
shan't be bothering your family any longer.
The soldiers enter the doorway. Col. Landa silently points out the
area of the floor the Jews are hiding under.

COL. LANDA
So, Monsieur and Madame LaPadite,
I bid you adieu.
He motions to the soldiers with his index finger.
They TEAR UP the wooden floor with MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
The little farmhouse is filled with SMOKE, DUST, SPLINTERS,
SCREAMS, BULLET CASINGS, and even a little BLOOD.
With a hand motion from the colonel, the soldiers cut off their
gunfire. The colonel keeps his finger in the air to indicate
silence.

UNDERNEATH THE FLOORBOARDS
The entire Dreyfus family lies dead. Except for sixteen-year-old
SHOSANNA, who miraculously escaped being struck by the Nazis'
bullets. With her dead family surrounding her, the young girl goes
for freedom (represented by a wire-mesh vent).

COL. LANDA
hears a movement underneath the floor, looks down, and sees a SHAPE
moving forward between the planks in the floor.

COL. LANDA
It's the girl. Nobody move!

VENT
is KICKED open, the girl SPRINGS out.

COL. LANDA
as he crosses the floor, sees the young girl RUNNING toward the
cover of the woods. He unlatches the window and opens it. Shosanna
is perfectly FRAMED in the windowsill.

SHOSANNA
RUNNING toward the woods. Farmhouse and Colonel in the window in

the safety of the woodpile, in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
Au revoir, Shosanna!

SHOSANNA
makes it to the woods and is gone.
The S.S. colonel closes the window.

EXT—DAIRY FARM—DAY
The Nazi town car DRIVES away.

EXT—NAZI TOWN CAR (MOVING)—DAY
Col. Hans Landa sits in the backseat of the convertible that's
speeding away from the French farmhouse.
Landa speaks to his driver in GERMAN, SUBTITLE IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
Herrman, I sense a question on your lips?
Out with it?

DRIVER
Why did you allow an enemy of the state to
escape?

COL. LANDA
Oh, I don't think the state is in too much
danger, do you?

DRIVER
I suppose not.

COL. LANDA
I'm glad you see it my way. Besides,
not putting a bullet in the back of a fifteen-
year-old girl and allowing
her to escape are not necessarily
the same thing. She's a young girl, no food, no
shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed the
massacre of her entire family.
She may not survive the night. And after
word spreads about what happened today, it's
highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers
to extend her aid.
If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll
probably be turned in by some neighbor.
Or she'll be spotted by some German soldier. Or
we'll find her body in the woods, dead from
starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps . . . she'll
survive. She will elude capture. She will escape
to America. She will move to New York City,
where she will be elected President of
the United States.
The S.S. colonel chuckles at his little funny.

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER TWO

"INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS"

FADE UP

EXT—SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND—DAY
A bunch of SOLDIERS are lined up at attention.
LIEUTENANT ALDO RAINE, a hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee,
walks down the line. He recruits the men the
Germans will later call "The Basterds." Lt. Aldo has one
defining physical characteristic, a ROPE BURN around his
neck—as if, once upon a time, he survived a LYNCHING.
The scar will never once be mentioned.

LT. ALDO
My name is Lt. Aldo Raine, and I'm puttin'
together a special team.
And I need me eight soldiers.
Eight—Jewish—American—soldiers.
Now y'all might of heard rumors
about the armada happening soon.
Well, we'll be leavin' a little
earlier. We're gonna be dropped
into France, dressed as civilians.
And once we're in enemy territory, as
a bushwackin', guerrilla army, we're gonna be
doin' one thing, and one thing only—Killin'
Nazis.
The members of the National Socialist Party
have conquered Europe through murder, torture,
intimidation, and terror. And that's exactly
what we're gonna do to them. Now I don't know
'bout y'all? But I sure as hell didn't come
down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross
five thousand miles
of water, fight my way through half Sicily, and
then jump out of a fuckin' air-o-plane to teach
the Nazis
lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got
no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a
Jew-hatin', mass-murderin' maniac, and they
need to be destroyed.
That's why any and every son-of-a-bitch we find
wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die.

LT. ALDO

(CON'T)
We will be cruel to the Germans,
and through our cruelty, they will
know who we are. They will find the evidence of
our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered,
and
disfigured bodies of their brothers
we leave behind us. And the Germans
will not be able to help themselves
from imagining the cruelty their brothers
endured at our hands, and
our bootheels, and the edge of our knives.
And the Germans will be sickened by us. And the
Germans will talk about us.
And the Germans will fear us.
And when the Germans close their eyes at night
and their subconscious
tortures them for the evil they've done, it
will be thoughts of us
that it tortures them with.
He stops pacing and looks at everybody.

LT. ALDO
Sound good?
They all say:

ALL
Yes, sir!

LT. ALDO
That's what I like to hear. But I
got a word of warning to all would-be warriors.
When you join my command,
you take on debit. A debit you owe
me, personally. Every man under my command owes
me one hundred Nazi scalps. And I want my
scalps.
And all y'all will git me one hundred
Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of
one hundred dead Nazis . . .
or you will die trying.

BERCHTESGADEN

(HITLER'S PRIVATE LAIR)"

INT—BERCHTESGADEN—DAY
In a huge room, ADOLF HITLER pounds on a big table with
his fist as he rants at TWO GERMAN GENERALS.
They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

HITLER
How much more of these Jew swine
must I endure? They butcher my men
like they were fish bait! This pack
of filthy degenerates are doing what
the Russian army didn't and Patton's army
couldn't—turning soldiers of
the Third Reich into superstitious
old women!

GERMAN GENERAL
Just the cowards among them, mein Fuhrer.
Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.

HITLER
No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
the rumors myself! Soldiers of the Third Reich,
who have brought the world to their knees, now
pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know
the latest rumor they've conjured up, in their
fear-induced delirium? The one that beats
my boys with a bat. The one they call "the Bear
Jew" . . . is a golem.
An avenging Jew angel, conjured up by
a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!

GENERAL
Mein Fuhrer, this is just soldiers' gossip. No
one really believes the
Bear Jew is a golem.

HITLER
Why not? They seem to be able to elude capture
like an apparition.
They seem to be able to appear and disappear at
will.

HITLER

(CON'T)
You want to prove they're flesh and blood? Then

BRING THEM TO ME!
I will hang them naked, by their
heels, from the Eiffel Tower!
And then throw their bodies in
the sewers, for the rats of Paris
to feast!
The Fuhrer sits down at the table to compose himself and
wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.

HITLER
(disgusted)
The Bear Jew.
He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.

HITLER
Kliest!
KLIEST'S VOICE comes out of the intercom:

KLIEST'S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Fuhrer.

HITLER
I have an order I want relayed to all German
soldiers stationed in France.
The Jew degenerate known as the Bear
Jew henceforth is never to be
referred to as the Bear Jew again.
We will cease to aid the Americans
any longer in their attempt to
undermine the German soldier's psyche. Did you
get that, Kliest?

KLIEST'S VOICE (OS)
Yes, mein Fuhrer. Do you still wish
to see Private Butz?

HITLER
Who and what is a private Butz?

KLEIST'S VOICE (OS)
He's the soldier you wanted to see personally.
His squad was ambushed
by Lt. Raine's Jews. He was its only survivor.

HITLER
Indeed I do want to see him. Thank
you for reminding me. Send him in.

EXT—FRENCH WOODS—DAY

CU FACE OF DEAD GERMAN SOLDIER
His head lies on the ground, horizontal. A HAND reaches into
the FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriot's helmet, and grabs
a handful of the cadaver's blond hair. A LARGE KNIFE
ENTERS THE FRAME and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
This process is called SCALPING.
After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off, like a
banana skin.

GERMAN PRISONERS PVT. BUTZ AND SGT. RACHTMAN
on their knees, hand behind their heads.
Pvt. Butz NARRATES the scene in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN

ENGLISH:

PVT. BUTZ (VO)
Werner and I were the only ones left alive
after the ambush. While one man guarded us, the
rest removed the hair. All the Basterds wore
German scalps
tied to their belts.

CU SCALPS
hanging from belts.

PVT. BUTZ (VO)
They not only took valuables . . .

WE SEE QUICK CUTS OF
rings, weapons, an iron cross, and somebody digging out a gold
tooth with a knife, being removed from dead Germans.

PVT. BUTZ (VO)
. . . They also took their identification
papers . . .

PVT. BUTZ (VO)
The Basterds took their lives, their hair,
their valuables, their identity, and finally
their dignity in death.
True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet
does rob the tableau of a certain dignity that is normally
felt in battlefield shots.

BACK TO HITLER

HITLER
The dogs!
He fights his frustration, then . . .

HITLER
Continue.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Aldo screams to the Basterd who's guarding the two German
prisoners.

LT. ALDO
Hey, Hirschberg, send that kraut
sarge over.

BASTERD PFC. HIRSCHBERG
KICKS Sgt. Rachtman in the back.

PFC. HIRSCHBERG
You! Go!
Sgt. Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
in the ass, sending him on his way.
Most of the Basterds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
Aldo in the middle.
As Sgt. Rachtman walks toward this circle of Basterds,
An OFFSCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt. Butz) speaks over
the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH:

NARRATOR (VO)
Sergeant Werner Rachtman has seen many
interrogations since Germany decided
it should rule Europe. But this is
the first time he's ever been on the
wrong end of the exchange.
It's always been his belief that
only a weakling in mind, body, and spirit
complies with the enemy under threat of consequence.
As Werner watched men cry like women,
pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
exchange for their worthless lives,
he made a vow to himself.
If his role is to die in this conflict,
when they put him under the earth,
his dignity would be buried with him.
For in the other world, the gods only
respect the ones they test first.
Well, Sergeant, this is your test.
And the gods are watching.
The captured German sergeant enters the circle of Basterds, stands
straight before the sitting southern lieutenant, and salutes his
captor.

SGT. RACHTMAN

(ENGLISH)
Sgt. Werner Rachtman.
Aldo returns the salute, looking at up him.

LT. ALDO
Lt. Aldo Raine. Pleased to meet cha.
You know what sit down means, Werner?

SGT. RACHTMAN
Yes.

LT. ALDO
Then sit down.
The German sergeant does.

LT. ALDO
How's your English, Werner? Cause if need be,
we gotta couple fellas
can translate.
Aldo points at one of the Basterds in the circle,

CPL. WILHELM WICKI.

LT. ALDO
Wicki there, an Austrian Jew, got the fuck
outta Salzberg while the
gettin' was good. Became American,
got drafted, and came back to give
y'all what for.
Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big, scary-looking Basterd,
in a German sergeant's uniform, named SGT. HUGO STIGLITZ.

LT. ALDO
And another one over there you
might be familiar with, Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz.
Heard of 'em?
The two German sergeants look at each other.

SGT. RACHTMAN
Everybody in the German army's heard
of Hugo Stiglitz.
The Basterds laugh, and a couple pat Hugo on the back.
The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.

NARRATOR (VO)
The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's
celebrity among German soldiers
is simple.
WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).

NARRATOR (VO)
As a German enlisted man, he killed thirteen
Gestapo officers, mostly
majors.

WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.

NARRATOR (VO)
Instead of putting him up against
a wall, the High Command decided to
send him back to Berlin, to be made
an example of.
Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a
prison convoy, en route to Berlin.

NARRATOR (VO)
Needless to say, once the Basterds
heard about him, he never got there.

EXT—FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE—DAY
The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.
They walk to the back of the troop truck. Inside, Hugo, in chains,
stares back at them.

LT. ALDO
Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz?
Hugo nods.

LT. ALDO
I'm Lt. Aldo Raine, and these are
the Basterds. Ever heard of us?
Hugo nods his head, yes.

LT. ALDO
We just wanna say, we're a big fan of your
work. When it comes to killin' Nazis, I think
you show great talent, and I pride myself on
havin' an eye for that kind of talent. But your
status as a Nazi killer is still amateur. We
all came here to see if you wanna go pro?

BACK TO THE BASTERD CIRCLE.

LT. ALDO
Now Werner, I'm gonna assume you know who we
are?

SGT. RACHTMAN
Aldo the Apache.
The circle of Basterds giggle.

LT. ADLO
Well, Werner, if you heard of us, you probably
heard we ain't in the
prisoner-takin' business. We in the killin'
Nazi business. And cousin, business is boomin'.
The Basterds laugh.

LT. ALDO
Now that leaves two ways we can play this out.
Either kill ya or let ya
go. Now whether or not you gonna
leave this circle alive depends
entirely on you.
Aldo takes out a map of the area and lays it out in front
of his prisoner.

LT. ALDO
Up the road a piece, there's a
orchard. 'Sides you, we know there's another
kraut patrol fuckin' around
here somewhere. Now if that patrol
were to have any crack shots, that orchard
would be a goddamn sniper's delight. Now if you
ever wanna eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again, you
gotta show me on this map where
they are, you gotta tell me how many they are,
and you gotta tell me
what kinda artillery they carrying
with 'em.

SGT. RACHTMAN
You can't expect me to divulge information that
would put German
lives in danger.

LT. ALDO
Well, Werner, that's where you're wrong.
Because that's exactly what I expect.
I need to know about Germans hidin'
in trees. And you need to tell me.
And you need to tell me, right now.
Now take your finger and point out
on this map where this party's bein' held, how
many's comin', and what they brought to play
with.
Werner sits, head held high, back straight, chin up, every
inch the German hero facing death.

SGT. WERNER
I respectfully refuse, sir.
Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.

LT. ALDO
You see that ole boy battin' rocks?
WE RACK-FOCUS to one of the Basterds not in the circle.
He's wearing a wife beater and power-hitting stones
with a baseball bat.
Werner's eyes go to the ballplayer.

LT. ALDO
That's Sgt. Donny Donowitz. But you might know
him better by his nickname, the Bear Jew. Now
if you heard of
Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about the Bear
Jew?

SGT. RACHTMAN
I heard.

LT. ALDO
What did you hear?

SGT. RACHTMAN
He beats German soldiers with a club.

LT. ALDO
He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat,
what he does.

SGT. DONOWITZ
back to us, still haven't seen his face. He Babe Ruths a
rock soaring into the atmosphere.

LT. ALDO
Now, Werner, I'm gonna ask you one
last goddamn time, and if you still
"respectfully refuse," I'm calling the Bear Jew
over here, and he's gonna take that big bat of
his, and he's gonna beat your ass to death with
it.
Now take your Wiener-schnitzel-lickin' finger
and point out on this map
what I want to know.

SGT. RACHTMAN
Fuck you and your Jew dogs.
Instead of getting mad, the Basterds burst out LAUGHING.
Also says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice:

LT. ALDO
Actually, Werner, we're all tickled
ya said that. Frankly, watchin' Donny beat
Nazis to death is the closest
we ever get to goin' to the movies.

(YELLING)

Ah, just dandy, Mr. Goorowitz.

MR. GOOROWITZ
Your mother, your father—everything

DONNY
They're just fine. I'm shippin' off next week.
The store proprietor extends his hand to the young man.

MR. GOOROWITZ
Good for you, son. Kill one of those Nazi
basterds for me, will ya?

DONNY
That the idea, Mr. Goorowitz.

MR. GOOROWITZ
What can I do you for, Donny?

DONNY
I need a baseball bat.
The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats in it. Donny
starts going through them without saying anything.
Mr. Goorowitz watches.

MR. GOOROWITZ
You gettin' your little brother a present
before you ship out?
Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up:

DONNY
No.
Donny's "no" silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to
settle on one, feeling its weight in his hands.

DONNY
Can I try this one on for size, outside?
Extending his arm:

MR. GOOROWITZ
Be my guest.
The phone rings.

MR. GOOROWITZ
I'll get that. You go right ahead.
The proprietor answers the phone and gets into a
conversation with his OFFSCREEN mother.
Donny walks outside. WE STAY IN STORE but can see him
clearly through the store's big picture window.
However, Mr. Goorowitz instinctively turns his back to Donny
to speak with his mother.
Donny starts swinging the bat. It's pretty obvious he's pantomiming
beating somebody to death with it. Then
he starts yelling:

DONNY
Take that, ya Nazi basterd! You like
fuckin' with the Jews? Wanna fuck with the Jews?
The American Jews are gonna FUCK with you . . . !
Mr. Goorowitz sees none of this as he speaks to his
mother. He hangs up the phone just as Donny walks back into
the store. The store owner turns to the store customer.

DONNY

How can I help you?

DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein?

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
State your business, young man.

DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, I'm Donny Donowitz.
My father, Sy Donowitz, owns the barber shop on
Greeny Ave. Sy's Barber Shop.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I've seen it. Do you live in the neighborhood?

DONNY
All my life.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Again, state your business?

DONNY
May I have a word with you?

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What about?

DONNY
Our people in Europe.
She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
young man.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Come in. Would you like some tea?

INT—MRS. HIMMELSTEIN'S APARTMENT—DAY
Donny sits on an overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
saucer in his hand. Mrs. Himmelstein sits on an overstuffed chair,
holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.

DONNY
(sipping tea)
Very good.

MRS. HIMMSELSTEIN
If you like tea.
Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
stone. She wasn't joking. He places his saucer on the coffee table
and begins:

DONNY
Mrs. Himmelstein, do you have any loved ones
over in Europe who you're concerned for?

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
What compels you, young man, to ask a stranger
such a personal question?

DONNY
Because I'm going to Europe. And I'm gonna make
it right.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?
He holds up his bat.

DONNY
With this.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And what exactly do you intend to do with that
toy?

DONNY
I'm gonna beat every Nazi I find to
death with it.
She takes another sip of tea.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
I thought we were having tea together.
Donny picks up his cup and takes a sip.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
And in this pursuit, how is it that I can be of
service?

DONNY
I'm going through the neighborhood.
If you have any loved ones in Europe whose
safety you fear for, I'd like
you to write their name on my bat.

BACK TO BASTERDS
Donna takes a long walk to Werner . . .

PVT. BUTZ
watches all this . . .
As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER WAITING,
WE ALSO CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DONNY and

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN . . .

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
You must be a real basterd, Donny.

DONNY
You bet your sweet ass I am.

MRS. HIMMELSTEIN
Hand me your sword, Gideon. I do believe I will
join you on this journey.
She signs the BAT: "MADELEINE."
Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi:
He sees the Iron Cross hanging from the German Sgt's right pocket.
The Jew taps the German's medal with the end of his bat.

DONNY
You get that for killing jews?

SGT RACHTMAN
Bravery.
Donny gives him a "oh yeah, we'll see about that," look.
The Bear Jew raises the bat up high over his shoulder and brings it
down hard against the side of Rachtman's head.
Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
the Basterds.

PVT. BUTZ
watches. Hirschberg says to him:

PFC. HIRSCHBERG
About now, I'd be shittin' my pants, if I was
you.
Aldo points a finger at Butzs and crooks it toward him.
A crying, visibly shaken Butz sits down in front of Aldo.

LT. ALDO
You wanna live?

PVT. BUTZ
Yes, sir.

LT. ALDO
Point out on this map the German position.
His arm shoots out like a rocket and points out the positions.

PVT. BUTZ
This area here.

LT. ALDO
How many?

PVT. BUTZ
Maybe twelve.

LT. ALDO
What kind of artillery?

PVT BUTZ
They have a machine gun dug in here pointing
north.

BACK TO HITLER

HITLER
How did you survive this ordeal?
WE SEE Pvt. Butz in the Fuhrer's room for the first time.
He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of the
Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it.

PVT. BUTZ
They let me go.

FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.

LT. ALDO
Now, when you report what happened here,
you can't tell 'em you told us what you
told us. They'll shoot ya. But they're gonna
wanna know, why you so special, we let you
live? So tell 'em we let ya live so you
could spread the word through the ranks
what's gonna happen to every Nazi we find.

HITLER
You are not to tell anybody anything! Not one
word of detail! Your outfit
was ambushed, and you got away.
Not one more word.

PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Fuhrer.
Pause.

HITLER
Did they mark you like they did the other
survivors?

PVT. BUTZ
Yes, mein Fuhrer.

HITLER
Remove your hat and show me.

LT. ALDO
Now say we let ya go, and say you survive the
war? When you get back
home, what 'cha gonna do?

PVT. BUTZ
I will hug my mother like I've never hugged her
before.

LT. ALDO
Well, ain't that a real nice boy. Are you going
to take off your uniform?

PVT. BUTZ
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend to
burn it!
The young German is telling Aldo what he thinks Aldo wants
to hear. But the last answer didn't go down as well as he
thought it would, as is evident by the frown on Aldo's face.

LT. ALDO
Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't like
that. You see, we like our Nazis
in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em just
like that.
(snaps his fingers)
But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody
gonna know you was a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.

LT. ALDO
So I'm gonna give ya a little somethin' you
can't take off.

BACK TO HITLER
Pvt. Butz removes his combat helmet. Hair hangs in his face. He
moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND-

CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.

BACK TO BASTERDS

BUTZ'S POV
on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
swastika, and he's holding the bloody knife. All the
Basterds crowd around to admire his handiwork.

SGT. DONOWITZ
You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty
good at that.

LT. ALDO
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't
cha? Practice.

FADE TO BLACK

OVER BLACK

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER THREE

"GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS"

INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However, the
CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the screen.
We start CLOSE on the projector beam emanating from
the little glass window in the back of the theater.
The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the shot wider and
wider, bringing in more and more the German-occupied citizens
of Paris, who stare at the OFFSCREEN silver screen in the dark.
We can hear the OFFSCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels-produced German
omm-pa-pa musical movie being projected.
The shot continues to pull farther and farther back, and the German
dialogue continues to fill the auditorium . . .

UNTIL . . .
The DOLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSEUP of Shosanna, watching the
movie.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

"SHOSANNA DREYFUS

TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE

OF SHOSANNA'S FAMILY"
We hear the sound of the German musical's climax.
The lights go up in the auditorium.
Shosanna, dressed in a NURSE'S UNIFORM she swiped from
somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS gather their
coats and file out.

EXT—LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)—NIGHT
Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside SHUTS
OFF the marquee's lights.
The MARQUEE READS in French:
"GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO."

EXT—PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
A French black man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
is the cinema's projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking the
film reels off the projector and placing them on rewinds.

INT—AUDITORIUM

CU SHOSANNA
Still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is empty.
The owner of the cinema, an attractive-looking French woman,
who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
one of the cinema's opera-box balconies.
Looking down from her porch at the young girl, sitting in
the empty cinema.
The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH and SUBTITLED IN

ENGLISH.

MADAME MIMIEUX
So, young woman, since it's beyond obvious we're
closed for the evening, I must assume you want
something. What can I do for you?

SHOSANNA
May I sleep here tonight?

MADAME MIMIEUX
So I gather you're not a nurse?

SHOSANNA
No.

MADAME MIMIEUX
But you're a bright little thing. That's a
clever disguise. Where is your family?

SHOSANNA
Murdered.

MADAME MIMIEUX
So you're a war orphan?

SHOSANNA
We were from Nancy. The Boches found us—

MADAME MIMIEUX
—Is this a sad story?

SHOSANNA.
Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Sad stories bore me. These days everyone in
Paris has one. I haven't bored you with mine.
Don't bore me with yours.

SHOSANNA
You can run the machines?

MADAME MIMIEUX
What machines?
Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
projector, she says:

SHOSANNA
The machines that show the film.

MADAME MIMIEUX
The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema.
Of course I can operate them.

SHOSANNA
I know, I saw you.

FLASH ON:

CU SHOSANNA
eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
watching . . .

MADAME MIMIEUX
expertly working the projectors . . .

BACK TO SHOSANNA

SHOSANNA
Teach me. Teach me to run the machines that
show the film. It's only you and
the negro. I know you could use some help.

MADAME MIMIEUX
I know at least six people who've been put up
against a wall and machine-
gunned for sheltering enemies of the state. I
have no intention of being unlucky number
seven. How long have
you been in Paris?

SHOSANNA
A week and a few days.

MADAME MIMIEUX
How have you survived the curfew
without capture?

SHOSANNA
I sleep on rooftops.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Again, I'm forced to admit, clever
girl. How is it?

SHOSANNA
Cold.

MADAME MIMIEUX
(laughs)
I can imagine.

SHOSANNA
Respectfully, no you can't.
Pause.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Fair enough.
Thinks . . .

MADAME MIMIEUX
So you can't operate a 35mm film projector. You
want me to teach you, in order to work here, in
order to use my cinema as a hole to hide in. Is
that correct?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX
What's your name?

SHOSANNA
Shosanna.

MADAME MIMIEUX
I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call
me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
home for wayward war orphans.
Having said that, what you say is true.
If you were truly exceptional, I could
find use for you. So, Shosanna, are you
truly exceptional?

SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
I will be the judge of that.

DISSOLVE TO

TITLE CARD:
Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
complete with Eiffel Tower.

ABOVE IT READS:

"1944

PARIS"

THEN . . .
The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE CARD
at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the little cinema's
projection booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
month is JUNE . . .
The CAMERA finds the THREE-YEARS-OLDER SHOSANNA working
as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear that Shosanna passed
Madame Mimieux's exceptional test.
A lyrical, Morricone-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK. This
will be "Shosanna's Theme."
A little bell begins RINGING on one of the projectors,
alerting Shosanna its time for a REEL CHANGE.
Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
she's projecting, waiting for the FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK . . .

SILVER SCREEN
of the little cinema. Onscreen LENI RIEFENSTAHL lies
horizontal as an icicle drips on her head in the old
German film "The White Hell of Pitz Palu."
The FIRST REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper-right-
hand corner of the FRAME (that tells the projectionist
to get ready).
As the FILM REEL on the FIRST PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna stands
ready, waiting by the SECOND PROJECTOR . . .

WHEN . . .

SILVER SCREEN
the SECOND REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place (that's the
one).

SHOSANNA
THROWS the lever on the SECOND PROJECTOR, switching the film from
projector 1 to projector 2, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
As "Shosanna's Theme" plays on the soundtrack, we watch, via
MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores: carry heavy film cans
up the stairs, empty the rat traps, etc, etc. . . .

EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The MARQUEE READS in French:
"GERMAN NIGHT LENI RIEFENSTAHL in PABST'S WHITE HELL OF PITZ PALU"
Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
LETTERS (for the marquee) and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack in ENGLISH:

NARRATOR (VO)
To operate a cinema in Paris during
the occupation, one had two choices. Either you
could show new German propaganda films, produced
under the watchful
eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or . . . you
could have a German night in your
weekly schedule and show allowed
German classic films.
Their German night was Thursday.
Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
the letters on the marquee.
A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER (about the same age as Shosanna) walks
out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
girl on top and walks over.
They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

GERMAN SOLDIER
What starts tomorrow?
Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German soldier smiling up at
her from below.

SHOSANNA
A Max Linder festival.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Ummm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin.
Except Linder never made a
film as good as "The Kid." The chase climax of
"The Kid," superb.
Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

GERMAN SOLDIER
I suppose now you could use an M,
an A, and an X?

SHOSANNA
No need, I can manage.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Don't be ridiculous. It's my pleasure.
He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.

SHOSANNA
Merci.

GERMAN SOLDIER
I adore your cinema very much.

SHOSANNA
Merci.
She busies herself with the marquee letters . . .

GERMAN SOLDIER
Is it yours?

SHOSANNA
Do I own it?

GERMAN SOLDIER
Oui.

SHOSANNA
Oui.

GERMAN SOLDIER
How does a young girl such as yourself own a
cinema?
Due to his uniform and Shosanna's situation, his efforts
at trying to make small talk strike the young Jewess in
hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.

SHOSANNA
My aunt left it to me.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Lucky girl.
Shosanna makes no reply back.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Merci for hosting a German night.

SHOSANNA
I don't have a choice, but you're welcome.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Do you choose the German films yourself?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Then my merci stands. I love the Riefenstahl
mountain films, especially "Pitz Palu." It's
nice to see a French girl who's an admirer of
Riefenstahl.

SHOSANNA
"Admire" would not be the adjective
I would use to describe my feelings toward
Fraulein Riefenstahl.

GERMAN SOLDIER
But you do admire the director Pabst, don't
you? That's why you included
his name on the marquee.
She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
private.

SHOSANNA
I'm French. We respect directors
in our country.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Apparently even Germans.

SHOSANNA
Even Germans. Merci for your assistance,
Private. Adieu.
She turns to go back inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER
You're not finished?

SHOSANNA
I'll finish in the morning.
She opens the door to go inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER
May I ask your name?

SHOSANNA
You wish to see my papers?
She hands him her excellently forged papers.
That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
to read her name.

COL. LANDA
Emmanuelle Mimieux. That's a very
pretty name.

SHOSANNA
Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
He hands them back.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Mademoiselle. My name is Frederick Zoller.
She gives no response.

GERMAN SOLDIER
It's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow
cinema lover. Sweet dreams, Mademoiselle.
He gives her a little salute and walks into the black of a curfew-
imposed night.
She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kind of got to her.
After all, for any true cinema lover, it's hard to hate anybody
who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

EXT—ROOFTOP CINEMA—NIGHT
Shosanna stands on the roof her her cinema, late at night, lighting
up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
she remembers a voice.

FLASH ON
MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black projectionist,
Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

MADAME MIMIEUX
If I ever see you light up a cigarette in my
cinema again, I'll turn you in to the Nazis, do
you understand?
Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
And for bringing an open flame into my cinema,
you deserve far worse than a Nazi Jewish
boxcar. With your thick head, what do you think
the highest priority of a cinema manager is?
Keeping this fucking place from burning down to
the ground, that's what!
In my collection, I have over three hundred and
fifty 35mm, nitrate film prints, which are not
only immensely flammable but highy unstable.
And should they catch fire, they burn three
times faster than paper. If that happens . . .
POOF . . . all gone, cinema no more, everybody
burned alive. If I ever
see you with an open flame in my cinema again,
I won't turn you into the Nazis. I'll kill you
myself. And the fucking Germans will give me a
curfew pass.
Do you understand me?

SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Do you believe me?

SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
You damn well better.

BACK TO ROOF
Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
Marcel comes onto the roof.

MARCEL
Are you well?

SHOSANNA
Even on the roof I can't smoke a cigarette
without hearing Madame's
voice yelling at me. That's why I
do it. To hear Madame's voice again.

MARCEL
We both miss her.

SHOSANNA
I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be
to bed soon.
Marcel goes back inside. Shosanna smokes.

INT—FRENCH BISTRO—AFTERNOON
Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
book, "The Saint in New York," by Leslie Charteris, drinking
wine when the young German soldier from the other day,
FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the French
girl sitting in the back. He smiles and heads over
to her. "Oh no, not this guy again," she thinks.
Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FREDRICK
May I join you?

SHOSANNA
Look, Fredrick—

FREDRICK
(smiling)
—You remember my name?

SHOSANNA
Yes . . . Look, you seem a pleasant
enough fellow—

FREDRICK
—Merci.

SHOSANNA
You're welcome. Regardless, I want you to stop
pestering me.

FREDRICK
I apologize, Mademoiselle. I wasn't trying to
be a pest. I was simply
trying to be friendly.

SHOSANNA
I don't wish to be your friend.

FREDRICK
Why not?

SHOSANNA
Don't act like an infant. You know why.

FREDRICK
I'm more than just a uniform.

SHOSANNA
Not to me. If you are so desperate for
a French girlfriend, I suggest you try Vichy.
Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which neither Shosanna or the non-German-
speaking members of the movie's audience can understand.
He signs autographs for them and shakes their hands, and they
go on their way.
Shosanna's eyes narrow.

SHOSANNA
Who are you?

FREDRICK
I thought I was just a uniform.

SHOSANNA
You're not just a German soldier. Are you
somebody's son?

FREDRICK
Most German soldiers are somebody's son.

SHOSANNA
Yeah, but you're not just somebody. What are
you, Hitler's nephew?
He leans in across the table. She leans in too, and he says:

FREDRICK
Yes.

SHOSANNA
Really?

FREDRICK
No, not really. I'm just teasing you.
She leans back, annoyed.

SHOSANNA
Then what is it? What are you, a German movie
star?

FREDRICK
Not exactly.

SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) What does that mean, "not exactly"? I
asked if you were a movie star. The answer to
that question is yes or no.
Fredrick laughs at that line.

FREDRICK
When you said that just now, you reminded me of
my sister.
This catches young Shosanna off guard.

FREDRICK
I come from a home of six sisters.
We run a family-operated cinema in Munich.
Seeing you run around your cinema
reminds me of them. Especially my sister
Helga. She raised me, when our father
wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
much. You'd like her. She doesn't wear a
German uniform.

SHOSANNA
You were raised by Helga?

FREDRICK
All my sisters. I'm the baby, but Helga was the
bossiest.

SHOSANNA
And your mother and father?

FREDRICK
My mother died. And my father was a
loser. My father's motto: "If at first
you don't succeed, quit." The day he
left, good riddance. My sisters are
all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
It makes me feel both closer to them
and a little homesick at the same time.

SHOSANNA
Is your cinema still operating?

FREDRICK
Oui.

SHOSANNA
What's it called?

FREDRICK
The Kino Haus.

SHOSANNA
How has it done during the war?

FREDRICK
Actually, in Germany, cinema
attendance is up.

SHOSANNA
No doubt. You don't have to operate under a
curfew.

FREDRICK
How often do you fill your house?

SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) Not since before the war.

FREDRICK
So if you had one big engagement, that would
help you out?

SHOSANNA
Of course, but that's not likely to happen.
TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
the table. They ask for Fredrick's autograph, and he signs it for
them. One of the French girls says, in FRENCH, how exciting
it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.

SHOSANNA
So you're a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

FREDRICK
Everybody knows that. I liked that you didn't.

SHOSANNA
What did you do?
He takes a sip of beer.

FREDRICK
I've shot the most enemy soldiers
in World War Two . . . so far.
You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

SHOSANNA
Wow.

FREDRICK
I was alone in a bell tower in a
walled-off city in Russia. It was
myself and a thousand rounds of ammo
in a bird's nest, against three
hundred Soviet soldiers.

SHOSANNA
What's a bird's nest?

FREDRICK
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call a
bell tower. It's a high structure, offering a
three-hundred-and-sixty-degree view. Very
advantageous for marksmen.

SHOSANNA
How many Russians did you kill?

FREDRICK
Sixty-eight.
(beat)
The first day. A hundred and fifty the second
day. Thirty-two the third day.
On the fourth day, they exited the city.
Naturally my war story received a lot of
attention in Germany. That's why they all
recognize me. They call me the German Sergeant
York.

SHOSANNA
Maybe they'll make a film about
your exploits.

FREDRICK
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels thought.
So he did. It's called "Nation's Pride," and
guess what, they wanted me to play myself, so I
did. They have posters for it in kiosks all
over Paris. That's another reason for all the
attention.

SHOSANNA
"Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's Pride"
is starring you?

FREDRICK
I know, comical, huh?

SHOSANNA
Not so comical. So what are you doing
in Paris, enjoying a rest?

FREDRICK
Hardly. I've been doing publicity, having my
pictures taken with different German
luminaries, visiting troops,
that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the film to
premiere in Paris, so I've been helping them in
the planning.
Joseph is very keen on this film.
He's telling anybody who will listen that
when "Nation's Pride" is released
I'll be the German Van Johnson.
Shosanna isn't falling for the young German by any stretch.
However, his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph,"
like they're friends, is all she needs to get on the right side of
things. This young man is trouble with a capital T, and
she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
She abruptly rises and says:

SHOSANNA
Well, good luck with your premiere, Private. I
hope all goes well for
Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
And with that, she disappears, leaving the perplexed private alone.

EXT—CINEMA MARQUEE—DAY
It's the next day.
Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
Shosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
ladder.

WHEN . . .
. . . A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back of
the sedan.
The DRIVER, a German private, steps out as well.
Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder:
Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.

GESTAPO MAJOR
Mademoiselle Mimieux?

SHOSANNA
Oui?
Telling his driver in German to ask her in French:

GESTAPO MAJOR
Ask her if this is her cinema.
In French the driver asks Shosanna:

DRIVER
Is this your cinema?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

GESTAPO MAJOR
Tell her to come down.

DRIVER
Come down, please.
She climbs down the ladder.
The driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her to
get in.

SHOSANNA
I don't understand. What have I done?

DRIVER
(to major)
She wants to know what she's done?

GESTAPO MAJOR
Who says she's done anything?

DRIVER
Who says you've done anything?
Then in her best imitation of Mademoiselle Mimeux's arrogant
manner.

SHOSANNA
Then I demand to know what this is about, and
where do you propose to take me?
The driver begins to translate when the Gestapo major holds up his
hand, telling him not to bother. The major looks at the young
French girl and tells her in German:

GESTAPO MAJOR
Get your ass in that car.
No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

INT—SEDAN (MOVING)—DAY
The Nazi sedan drives through the early-afternoon Paris
streets.

WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
her. We just hold on her face trying not to reveal anything.
The sedan stops.
The car door opens, and the driver offers Shosanna his hand.

EXT/INT—MAXIM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE)—DAY
She steps out of the car and is led into a Paris cafe by the
Gestapo officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
The best table at Maxim's. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it:
Germany's minister of propaganda and the number-two man in Hitler's
Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS; his female French translator (and
mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO; and young Private Zoller.
TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES belonging to Mademoiselle Mondino sit
together in another chair at the table.
We join the in mid-conversation:
They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

GOEBBELS
—it's only the offspring of slaves that
allows America to be competitive athletically.
American Olympic gold can be measured
in Negro sweat.
Shosanna is led through the French eatery by the Gestapo major.
Private Zoller sees her and stands up, excuses himself,
and greets her before she reaches the table.
Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

FREDRICK
Good you came. I wasn't sure whether or not
you'd accept my invitation.

SHOSANNA
Invitation?

THEN . . .
. . . Goebbels's voice says OFFSCREEN:

GOEBBELS (OS)
Is that the young lady in question, Fredrick?
Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
arm, and leads her to him.

FREDRICK
Yes, it is, Herr Goebbels. Emmanuelle, there is
somebody I want you to meet.
Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brulee into his mouth.
The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda minister
formally.

FREDRICK
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to introduce you
to the minister of propaganda, the leader of
the entire German film industry, and now I'm an
actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Goebbels offers up his long, spiderlike fingers for Shosanna to
shake. She does.

GOEBBELS
Your reputation precedes you, Fraulein Mimieux.
He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big bite
of tiramisu.
They all laugh.
Frederick jumps in . . .

FREDRICK
And normally, this is Herr Goebbels's French
interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca Mondino.

FRANCESCA
looks up at Shosanna.
NARRATOR'S VOICE comes on soundtrack:

NARRATOR (VO)
Francesca Mondino is much more than Goebbels's
French interpreter.
She's also Goebbels's favorite French
actress to appear in his films . . . . .

FLASH ON

FRENCH CLIP
from one of Francesca's B/W Goebbels produced productions.
Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG

GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL
I love you, I can't help it. My country or my
heart, which do I betray?
A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the film's title:

"SENTIMENTAL COMBAT" (1943)

FLASH ON
Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red velvet
bed.

NARRATOR (VO)
And Goebbels's favorite French mistress, to act
in his bed.
WE SEE JUST A SUPER-QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca DOGGY-

STYLE.

FRANCESCA
(animal-like)
Do it! Do it! Fuck me—fill me!

BACK TO FRANCESCA
looking at Shosanna.

FRANCESCA
Bonjour.

SHOSANNA
Bonjour.

FREDRICK
And you've met the major.
The Gestapo officer steps up and says to Fredrick in German:

GESTAPO MAJOR
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
(to Shosanna)
Major Dieter Hellstrom of the Gestapo, at your
service, Mademoiselle.
(he clicks
his heels)
Please allow me. Have a seat.
The Gestapo officer pulls out a chair for the young lady to sit
down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
Pvt. Zoller. To her left are the two curly, pampered
poodles. Major Hellstrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
from a small carafe on the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Try the wine, Mademoiselle. It's quite good.
Goebbels looks across the table at her.

GOEBBELS
Well, I must say, you've made quite an
impression on our boy.
Francesca interprets Goebbels's German for Shosanna.

GOEBBELS
I must say, Fraulein, I should be rather
annoyed with you.
Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS
I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch
with my star . . .
Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS
Little do I know he's become
the toast of Paris, and now he
must find time for me.
Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS
People wait in line hours, days,
to see me. For the Fuhrer and
Private Zoller, I wait.
Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS
So finally, I'm granted an audience
with the young private, and he spends the
entire lunch speaking of you
and your cinema.
Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS
So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down
to business.
Private Zoller interrupts—

FREDRICK
Herr Goebbels, I haven't informed
her yet.

GOEBBELS
Unless the girl's a simpleton, I'm
sure she's figured it out by now.
After all, she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
Francesca tells Shosanna in French:

FRANCESCA
What they're trying to tell you, Emmanuelle, is
Private Zoller has
spent the last hour at lunch,
trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
to abandon previous plans for Private Zoller's
film premiere and change the venue to your
cinema.
Zoller reacts.

FRANCESCA
(FRENCH to Zoller)
What?

FREDRICK
I wanted to inform her.

FRANCESCA
Shit. I apologize, Private. Of course you did.

GOEBBELS
(GERMAN to Francesca)
What's the issue?

FRANCESCA
The young soldier wanted to inform the
mademoiselle himself.

GOEBBELS
Nonsense. Until I ask a few
questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not
agreed to a venue change.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Duly noted.
Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna:

GOEBBELS
You have opera boxes?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

GOEBBELS
How many?

SHOSANNA
Three.

GOEBBELS
More would be better. How many
seats in your auditorium?

SHOSANNA
Three hundred and fifty.

GOEBBELS
That's almost four hundred less
than The Ritz.
Fredrick jumps in . . .

FREDRICK
But Herr Goebbels, that's not such
a terrible thing. You said yourself
you didn't want to indulge every
two-faced French bourgeois taking
up space currying favor. With less
seats it makes the event more
exclusive. You're not trying to fill
the house, they're fighting for seats.

FREDRICK

(CON'T)
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German
event, a German celebration. This
night is for you, me, the German military, the
High Command, their
family and friends. The only people
who should be allowed in the room
are people who will be moved by
the exploits onscreen.
Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause:

GOEBBELS
I see your public speaking has
improved. It appears I've created
a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When
the war's over,
politics awaits.
Table chuckles.

GOEBBELS
Well, Private, though it is true
I'm inclined to indulge you anything,
I must watch a film in this young
lady's cinema before I can say
yes or no.
(to Shosanna)
So, young lady, you are to close
your cinema tonight and have
a private screening for me.
Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS
What German films do you have?
Francesca asks . . .

SHOSANNA
My cinema, on German night, tends
to show older German classics.
Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS
Why not my films?
Francesca asks . . . ?

SHOSANNA
I draw an older German audience in
my cinema that appreciates the
nostalgia of an earlier time.
Francesca interprets . . .

GOEBBELS
That's nonsense, Fraulein. We Germans
are looking forward, not backward.
That era of German cinema is dead.
The German cinema I create will not
only be the cinema of Europe, but
the world's only alternative to the degenerate
Jewish influence of
Hollywood.
Fredrick jumps in . . .

FREDRICK
Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is
quite a formidable
film critic.
He chuckles, but alone.

GOEBBELS
So it would appear. Unfortunately
for the Fraulein, I've outlawed
film criticism.
Zoller, thinking fast, says:

FREDRICK
Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"?
I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen it.
And it's so funny. I've been meaning
to recommend it to her, for her
German night. That's a great idea.
Let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight.

GOEBBELS
Ahhh, "Lucky Kids," "Lucky Kids,"
"Lucky Kids." When all is said and
done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not
only that, I
wouldn't be surprised if sixty
years from now, it's "Lucky Kids"
that I'm the most remembered for.
I know it doesn't seem like it now,
but mark my words.
Very well, I'll have a print sent
over to the Fraulein's cinema.
We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight.
As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna . . .
the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
filled with the bottom half of a gray S.S. officer uniform.

GOEBBELS
Ah, Landa, you're here. This is the young lady
in question.
The S.S. officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the
first scene, COL. HANS LANDA.

FREDRICK
Emmanuelle, this is Col. Hans Landa of
the S.S. He'll be running security
for the premiere.

CU SHOSANNA
A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
The S.S. OFFICER
who murered her family takes her hand and kisses it,
saying in perfect French:

COL. LANDA
Charmed, Mademoiselle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Better known as "the Jew Hunter."
The table laughs.

GOEBBELS
Oh, Francesca, what was that funny
thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?

FRANCESCA
What thing?

GOEBBELS
You know, you were there. It was a
funny thing the Fuhrer said,
about Hans . . . something about a pig?
Francesca's memory is jogged.

FRANCESCA
Oh, yes, of course.
She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels's ear.

GOEBBELS
Oh, yes, of course, that's it. So
the Fuhrer said he wouldn't be
surprised if Hans weren't rooting
out Jews like a truffle pig from
the playpen.

FRANCESCA
That's what we need, pigs that can
root out Jews.

COL. LANDA
Who needs pigs when you have me?
Big, hearty laugh around the table.

GOEBBELS
Do you have an engagement tonight?

COL. LANDA
Well, as a matter of fact, I do—

GOEBBELS
—Break it. We're all going to the fraulein's
cinema tonight to view
"Lucky Kids."

COL. LANDA
Splendid.
Then the Reich minister's companion, Mademoiselle Mondino,
interrupts:

FRANCESCA
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels to
his next appointment.

GOEBBELS
Slave driver! French slave driver!
They all chuckle.
Everybody begins to stand up from the table . . .
Francesca gathers the stupid dogs . . .
As Col. Landa stands, he says:

COL. LANDA
Actually, in my role as security
chief of this joyous German occasion, I'm
afraid I must have a word with Mademoiselle
Mimieux.
Mademoiselle Mimieux's eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.

FREDRICK
What sort of discussion?

COL. LANDA
That sounded suspiciously like
a soldier questioning the order of a colonel?
Or am I just being sensitive?

FREDRICK
Nothing could be further from the
truth, Colonel. Your authority is
beyond question.
But your reputation precedes
you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?

GOEBBELS
Hans, the boy means no harm, he's
simply smitten. And he's correct.
Your reputation does precede you.
Laughter all around. The Reich minister and his Axis entourage make
their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on
a leash, leading the way.

COL. LANDA
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need
to have a chat with the possible
new venue's property owner.

FREDRICK
I was just hoping to escort
Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
cinema.

GOEBBELS
Nonsense! You can eat ice cream
and walk along the Seine another
time. Right now, allow Col. Landa
to do his job.
Everybody says their farewells.
Col. Landa offers the young Jew in hiding a seat at a small
table in the outside patio area of Maxim's.
The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. Jew hunter's
French reveals to the audience that his feigning clumsiness at
French with Monsieur LaPadite in the film's first scene was
simply an interrogation technique.
They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
Have you tried the strudel here?

SHOSANNA
No.

COL. LANDA
It's not so terrible. So how is it
the young private and yourself came
to be acquainted?
She's about to answer when a WAITER approaches.

COL. LANDA
Yes, two strudels, one for myself
and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
of espresso, with a container of
steamed milk on the side.
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
Considering that Shosanna grew up on a dairy farm, and the last
time she was on a dairy farm her strudel companion murdered her
entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
least . . . disconcerting.
The key to Col. Landa's power and/or charm, depending on the
side one's on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to
your secrets.
The waiter exits.

COL. LANDA
So, Mademoiselle, you were beginning
to explain . . . ?

SHOSANNA
(anxiously)
Up until a couple of days ago,
I had no knowledge of Private Zoller
or his exploits. To me, the private
was simply just a patron of my cinema. We spoke
a few times, but—

COL. LANDA
—Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you. This is a
simple formality, no
reason for you to feel anxious.
The strudel arrives.
The colonel takes one look at it and says to the waiter:

COL. LANDA
I apologize. I forgot to order the
creme fraiche.

WAITER
One moment.
He exits.

COL. LANDA
(referring to
the creme.)
Wait for the creme
(back to
business)
So, Emmanuelle—May I call you Emmanuelle?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

COL. LANDA
So, Emmanuelle, explain to me how
does it happen that a young lady
such as yourself comes to own a
cinema?
The waiter returns, applying creme fraiche to the two strudels.
The S.S. colonel looks across the table at his companion. Picking
up his fork, he says:

COL. LANDA
After you.
Shosanna takes a whipped-creamy bite of strudel. Landa follows her
lead.

COL. LANDA
(mouthful
of strudel)
Success?
Shosanna, mouth full of strudel, indicates she approves.

COL. LANDA
Like I said, not so terrible.
(back to
business)
So you were explaining the origin of your
cinema ownership?

SHOSANNA
The cinema originally belonged to
my aunt and uncle—
Col. Landa removes a little black book from his pocket.

COL. LANDA
—What are their names?

SHOSANNA
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
He records the names in his little book.

COL. LANDA
Where are they now?

SHOSANNA
My uncle was killed during the blitzkrieg.

COL. LANDA
Pity . . . Continue.

SHOSANNA
Aunt Ada passed away from fever
last spring.

COL. LANDA
Regrettable.
(respectful
pause)
It's come to my attention you have
a negro in your employ. Is that true?

SHOSANNA
Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He
worked with my aunt and
uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works
with me.

COL. LANDA
Doing what?

SHOSANNA
Projectionist.

COL. LANDA
Is he any good?

SHOSANNA
The best.

COL. LANDA
Actually, one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?

SHOSANNA
Of course I can.

COL. LANDA
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want
the success or failure of his illustrious
evening dependent on
the prowess of a negro. So if it
comes to pass that we hold this event
at your venue—talented, no doubt,
as your negro may be—you will
operate the projectors. Is that acceptable?
As if she has any say.

SHOSANNA
Oui.
Col. Landa takes another bite of strudel, and Shosanna follows
suit.

COL. LANDA
So it would appear our young hero is quite
smitten with you?

SHOSANNA
Private Zoller's feelings for me
aren't of a romantic nature.

COL. LANDA
Mademoiselle . . . ?

SHOSANNA
Colonel, his feelings are not
romantic. I remind him of his sister.

COL. LANDA
That doesn't mean his feelings
aren't romantic.

SHOSANNA
I remind him of his sister who
raised him.

COL. LANDA
It's sounding more and more romantic
by the minute.
Landa takes out a handsome-looking cigarette case, with an S.S.
LOGO on it. Removing one of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy
S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

COL. LANDA
Cigarette?

SHOSANNA
No, thank you.

COL. LANDA
Do you smoke?

SHOSANNA
Yes.

COL. LANDA
Then I insist, you must take one. They're not
French, they're German.
I hope you're not nationalist about
your tobacco. To me, French cigarettes are a
sin against nicotine.
She takes one but makes no move to light it.
He inhales deeply and says:

COL. LANDA
I did have something else I wanted
to ask you, but right now, for the
life of me, I can't remember what it is. Oh,
well, must not have been important.
Col. Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts
on his gray S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting
Shosanna, and says:

COL. LANDA
Till tonight.
And with that he's gone.
Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet and
ankles and the floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
During her conversation and strudel with the man who
exterminated her entire family, Shosanna pissed herself.
She drops the German cigarette into the piss puddle by her
feet.

INT—CINEMA AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The SILVER SCREEN
Onscreen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS."
We hear OFFSCREEN laughter at the onscreen Aryan antics.

CU GOEBBELS
watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.

CU FRANCESCA
laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.

CU TWO BLACK POODLES
pantingly watching the screen.

CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
smiling, smoking a German cigarette.

CU COL LANDA
smoking a German cigarette, amused.

CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
truly enjoying himself.

CU SHOSANNA
watching the screen.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

NARRATOR (VO)
While Shosanna sits there pretending
to be amused by the Aryan antics of Goebbel's
Frank Capra copy "Lucky
Kids," a thought suddenly comes to her.
We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

NARRATOR (VO)
What if tonight, accidently, the
cinema burned down? The Third Reich would lose
its minister of
propaganda, its national hero, and its top Jew
hunter, all in one fell swoop.
She chuckles at THAT thought, though it looks like she's
chuckling at the German comedy.

NARRATOR (VO)
But then that thought . . .
. . . led Shosanna
To a crazy idea.
The idea flashes on her face.
Then Shosanna bursts out laughing.
Zoller looks over at her. Happy.
She's enjoying the movie.

SILVER SCREEN
"The END" card for "Lucky Kids" is projected.
The Nazi rouges' gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.
The lights go up.
Goebbels accepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
file out into the lobby.

NARRATOR (VO)
The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a complete
success. And Herr Goebbels conceded to have the
venue changed
to Shosanna's cinema. Not only that,
in a moment of inspiration, Herr Goebbels had
an idea.
Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates:

GOEBBELS
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this auditorium. Your cinema
has real respect, almost churchlike.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the
place up a bit. In Versailles
there's a crystal chandelier hanging
in the banquet hall that is
extraordinary. We're going to get it
and hang it from the very middle of
the auditorium roof. Also I want to go to the
Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
and just scatter them about the lobby.

MONTAGE
We see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
Greek nude statues being hand-trucked out of the Louvre.
A truck driving through the French countryside with the enormous
crystal chandelier in the back.
The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
into place.
We see workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist the huge,
heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier in Shosanna's auditorium,
which now resembles something out of one of Tinto Brass's Italian
B-movie ripoffs of Visconti's "The Damned."

SHOSANNA
watches all this from an opera box. She shakes her head in
disbelief.

BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZIS
in the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Kids." She's soundlessly
escorting them to the door as they make their good-byes.

NARRATOR (VO)
As they left the little French
cinema that night, all the Germans
were very happy . . .
We see Pvt. Zoller hanging back, so he can say good-bye.

NARRATOR (VO)
None more so than Fredrick Zoller.
She closes the door on him, watching the Nazis walk into
Paris night. Their shadows for a moment on the wall, look
like grotesque Nazi caricatures.
The Nazis are gone.
Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking down
at Shosanna.
They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

MARCEL
What the fuck are we supposed to do?

SHOSANNA
It looks like we're supposed to have
a Nazi premiere.

MARCEL
Like I said, what the fuck are we supposed to
do?

SHOSANNA
Well, I need to speak with you
about that.

MARCEL
About what?

SHOSANNA
About these Hun swine, commandeering
our cinema.

MARCEL
What about it?
She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
his legs and sits on the lower step, between his legs, her
back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders, Shosanna
has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

SHOSANNA
Well, when I was watching that Boche
(said in
English)
Capra-corn abomination,
(back to
French)
I got an idea.

MARCEL
I'm confused. What are we talking
about?

SHOSANNA
Filling the cinema with Nazis and
their whores, and burning it down
to the ground.

MARCEL
I'm not talking about that. You're talking
about that.

SHOSANNA
No, we're talking about that,
right now. If we can keep this
place from burning down by
ourselves, we can burn it down
by ourselves.

MARCEL
Shosanna—

SHOSANNA
No, Marcel, just for the sake of argument, if we
wanted to burn down the cinema
for any number of reasons, you and I could
physically accomplish that, no?

MARCEL
Oui, Shosanna, we could do that.

SHOSANNA
And with Madame Mimieux's three hundred and fifty
nitrate film print collection,
we wouldn't even need explosives, would we?

MARCEL
You mean we wouldn't need any more explosives?

SHOSANNA
Oui, that's exactly what I mean.
She begins kissing his hands.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
I am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night.
One of his fingers probes her mouth.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
And if I'm going to burn down the cinema, which
I am, we both know
you're not going to let me do it
by myself.
The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand both
caresses and grips her lovely neck.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
Because you love me. And I love you.
And you're the only person on this earth I can
trust.
She then TWISTS around so she's straddling him. They are now
face to face.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
But that's not all we're going to do. Does the
filmmaking equipment in the attic still work? I
know the film
camera does. How about the sound recorder?

MARCEL
Quite well, actually. I recorded a
new guitarist I met in a cafe last
week. It works superb. Why do we
need filmmaking equipment?

SHOSANNA
Because Marcel, my sweet, we're
going to make a film. Just for the
Nazis.
She gives him a deep French kiss.

INT—ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE—DAY
A young MILITARY ATTACHE opens the sliding double doors
that serve as an entrance to the room.

MILITARY ATTACHE
Right this way, Lieutenant.
A snappy, handsome British lieutenant in dress brown steps inside
the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
the Gerrys since the late thirties, is LT. ARCHIE HICOX,
a young George Sanders type ("The Saint" and "Private Affairs of
Bel Ami" years).
Upon entering the room, Lt. Hicox is gobsmacked.
Standing before him is legendary military mastermind
GEN. ED FENECH, an older George Sanders type ("Village of the
Damned").
But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
smoking his ever-present cigar, is the unmistakable
bulk of WINSTON CHURCHILL.
The lieutenant was not expecting him.
Hicox salutes the general.

LT. HICOX
Lieutenant Hicox reporting, sir.

GEN. FENECH
(salutes back)
General Ed. Fenech. At ease, Hicox. Drink?
Hicox's eyes go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However, the man behind
the cigar makes no gesture, and the general makes no acknowledgment
of the three-hundred-pound gorilla in the room. Which Lt. Hicox
knows enough to mean, if Churchill isn't introduced, he ain't
there.

LT. HICOX
If you offered me a scotch and plain water, I
could drink a scotch and
plain water.

GEN. FENECH
That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it yourself, like
a good chap,
will you? Bar's in the globe.
Hicox heads over to the bar globe.

LT. HICOX
Something for yourself, sir?

GEN. FENECH
Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
The lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar and
busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
Fenech, eyeing the lieutenant's file.

GEN. FENECH
It says here you've run three
undercover commando operations in Germany and
German-occupied
territories? Frankfurt, Holland,
and Norway, to be exact?
Back to them, mixing drinks, he says:

LT. HICOX
Extraordinary people, the Norwegians.

GEN. FENECH
It says here you speak German fluently?

LT. HICOX
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

GEN. FENECH
And your occupation before the war?
His back still to us, as he bartends . . .

LT. HICOX
I'm a film critic.

GEN. FENECH
List your accomplishments?

LT. HICOX
Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews
and articles for a publication called "Films
and Filmmakers."
As well as our sister publication.

GEN. FENECH
What's that called?

LT. HICOX
"Flickers Bi-Monthly," and I've had
two books published.

GEN. FENECH
Impressive. Don't be modest, Lieutenant. What
are their titles?

LT. HICOX
The first book was called "Art of the Eyes, the
Heart, and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema
in the Twenties."
And the second one was called . . .
He turns around with his whiskey and plain water and the general's
whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
he walks toward the general, handing him his drink.

LT. HICOX
"Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci."
It's a subtextual film criticism
study of the work of German director
G. W. Pabst.
He hands the general his whiskey.

LT. HICOX
What should we drink to, sir?

GEN. FENECH
(thinking, for
a moment)
Down with Hitler.

LT. HICOX
All the way down, sir.

CLINK.

GEN. FENECH
Are you familiar with German cinema under the
Third Reich?

LT. HICOX
Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three
years, but I am familiar with it.

GEN. FENECH
Explain it to me.

LT. HICOX
Pardon, sir?

GEN. FENECH
This little escapade of ours
requires a knowledge of the German
film industry under the Third Reich. Explain to
me UFA, under Goebbels?

LT. HICOX
Goebbels considers the films he's
making to be the beginning of a new
era in German cinema—an alternative
to what he considers the Jewish
German intellectual cinema of the twenties and
the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.
SUDDENLY . . . bellowing from the back of the room:

CHURCHILL
How's he doing?

LT. HICOX
Frightfully sorry, sir, once again?

CHURCHILL
You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game? Compared to, say,
. . . Louis B. Mayer . . . how's he doing?

LT. HICOX
Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
has taken over, film attendance has steadily
risen in Germany over the
last eight years. But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't
be Goebbels' proper opposite number. I believe
Goebbels sees himself closer to David O.
Selznick.
Gen. Fenech looks to the prime minister.
With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchill says:

CHURCHILL
Brief him.

GEN. FENECH
Lt. Hicox, at this point in time I'd like to
brief you on Operation Kino. Three days from
now, Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris—

LT. HICOX
—What film, sir?
The general has to resort to peeking at his file.

GEN. FENECH
The motion pictures called "Nation's Pride."

LT. HICOX
Oh, you mean the film about Private Zoller?

GEN. FENECH
We don't have any intelligence on exactly what
the film that night
will be about.

LT. HICOX
But it's called "Nation's Pride"?

GEN. FENECH
Yes.

LT. HICOX
I can tell you what it's about.
It's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
He's the German Sargeant York.
Fenech can't help suppress a smile. They have the right man.

GEN. FENECH
In attendance at this joyous Germanic occasion
will be Goebbels, Goering, Boormann, and most
of the German High Command, including all the
high-ranking officers of both the S.S. and the
Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi
propaganda-film industry.

LT. HICOX
The master race at play, aye?

GEN. FENECH
Basically, we have all our rotten
eggs in one basket. The objective of Operation
Kino . . . Blow up the basket.

LT. HICOX
(reciting a
poem)
. . . and like the snows of yesteryear, gone
from this earth. Jolly good, sir.

GEN. FENECH
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines
will be your assist. The Germans call them "the
Basterds."

LT. HICOX
"The Basterds." Never heard of them.

GEN. FENECH
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Gerrys have heard of them, because
these Yanks have been them
the devil. Their leader is a chap
named Lieutenant Aldo Raine. The
Germans call him "Aldo the Apache."

LT. HICOX
Why do they call him that?

GEN. FENECH
Best guess is because he removes the scalps of
the Nazi dead.

LT. HICOX
Scalps, sir?

GEN. FENECH
The hair.
He runs his finger along his hairline.

GEN. FENECH
Like a red Injun.

LT. HICOX
Rather gruesome-sounding little dickybird,
isn't he?

GEN. FENECH
No doubt the whole lot, a bunch of nutters. But
you've heard the
expression "It takes a thief."

LT. HICOX
Indeed.
Gen. Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
to a military map.

GEN. FENECH
You'll be dropped into Franch about twenty-four
kilometers outside of Paris. The Basterds will
be waiting for you. First thing, you go to a
little village called Nadine.
(He points it out
on the map.)
Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
In Nadine, there's a tavern called
La Louisiane. You'll rendezvous
with our double agent, and she'll take it from
there. She's the one who's
going to get you into the premiere.
It will be you, her, and two German-
born members of the Basterds. She's
also made all the other arrangements you're
going to need.

LT. HICOX
How will I know her?

GEN. FENECH
I suspect that won't be too much
trouble for you. Your contract is Bridget von
Hammersmark.

LT. HICOX
Bridget von Hammersmark? The German movie star
is working for England?

GEN. FENECH
For the last two years now. One could even say
Operation Kino was her brainchild.
In the back of the room the bulldog barks:

CHURCHILL
Extraordinary woman.

LT. HICOX
Quite.

GEN. FENECH
You'll go to the premiere as her
escort, lucky devil. She'll also
have the premiere tickets for the
other two. Got the gist?

LT. HICOX
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
The three British bulldogs laugh.

EXT—CINEMA ROOFTOP—DAY
Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema
literally making a movie.
Marcel is behind an old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
positioned low, looking up.
Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
into it.
A old-timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
SUBTITLED into you know what.

MARCEL
We need a sync mark.

SHOSANNA
What is a sync mark?

MARCEL
An action and noise put together,
So we can sync up the picture
and sound.

SHOSANNA
How do we do that?

MARCEL
Clap your hands.
She does.

MARCEL
In frame, imbecile.
She claps her hands in front of her face.

MARCEL
Ready?
Shosanna takes a deep breath, then:

SHOSANNA
Ready.

MARCEL
Action.

WE CUT, BEFORE SHE SPEAKS, TO . . .

THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
Big difference. This time, it's in COLOR.

MARCEL
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop
that footage. How do we get
a 35mm print with a soundtrack?

SHOSANNA
Do you know one person who can do
both things?

MARCEL
Of course, Gaspar. Very nice man,
took care of all the experimental filmmakers.
But nobody in their
right mind would strike a print of
what you're talking about. If the
Nazis found out, their life wouldn't
be worth this.
He snaps his fingers.

SHOSANNA
In a wolf fight, you either eat the
wolf or the wolf eats you. If we're going to
obliterate the Nazis,
we have to use their tactics.

MARCEL
What does that mean?

SHOSANNA
We find somebody who can develop
and process a 35mm print. And we
make them do it or we kill them.
Once we tell them what we want to
do if they refuse, we have to kill
them anyway or they'll turn us in.

MARCEL
Would you do that?

SHOSANNA
Like that.
Snaps her fingers.

INT—SMALL FILM-PROCESSING LAB—LATE NIGHT
A old mom-and-pop film processing lab circa the thirties.
Late late at night.
GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE BEATING
at the hands of his friend Marcel.
Shosanna watches, pitiless.

SHOSANNA
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
Marcel holds Gaspar's arm behind him as he forces his head flat
against the tabletop.
Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
his face.

SHOSANNA
You either do what the fuck we tell
you to, or I'll bury this ax in your
collaborating skull.

GASPAR
I'm not a collaborator!

SHOSANNA
Then prove it! Or does your manhood
go no deeper than standing to piss? Marcel, do
his wife and children
know you?

MARCEL
Oui.

SHOSANNA
Then after we kill this dog for
Germans, we'll go and silence them.
She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high . . .

SHOSANNA
Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!

CUT TO

GASPAR
hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35MM FILM, Outside
the shop window, it's morning.

INT—PROJECTION ROOM
WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zoller's
life story, "Nation's Pride" (clearly marked), on the floor of
the projection booth.
The can for REEL 4 is open and empty.
Shosanna's at the editing bench. REEL 4 is up on the
rewinds . . .
Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcel's footage into REEL 4 of Fredrick's
film, rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
puts a piece of RED TAPE on the REEL 4 CAN.
She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind
her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.

BLACK FRAME

FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO

EXT—LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN)—NIGHT
We see a small basement tavern with an old rustic sign out
front that reads "La Louisiane."

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
"The village of
Nadine, France"
TWO SHOT LT. HICOX and LT. ALDO RAINE
Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
German gray S.S. captain's uniform. They look out of a window, in
an apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

LT. ALDO
You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous was in a
fuckin' basement.

LT. HICOX
I didn't know.

LT. ALDO
You said it was in a tavern?

LT. HICOX
It is a tavern.

LT. ALDO
Yeah, in a basement. You know,
fightin' in a basement offers a lot
of difficulties, number one being
you're fighting in a basement.
Wilhelm Wicki joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. lieutenant's
uniform.

WICKI
What if we go in there and she's
not even there?

LT. HICOX
We wait. Don't worry. She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.
WE SEE that the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
are in the room as well. They are Donowitz, Hirschberg,
and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the gray
uniform of an S.S. lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt, looped around his
boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterd's opening
chapter is dead.
Lt. Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the
room SHARPENING his dagger menacingly.
Stiglitz is fucking weird . . .
Lt. Hicox approaches Stiglitz . . .

LT. HICOX
Stiglitz, right?

STIGLITZ
That's right, sir.
He continues bringing the blade's edge up, then down on the leather
strap.

LT. HICOX
I hear you're pretty good with that?
Meaning the blade.
Stiglitz doesn't answer.

LT. HICOX
You know, we're not looking for
trouble right now. We're simply
making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful. However, on
the off chance I'm wrong and things prove
eventful, I need to know we can all remain
calm.
The renegade Gerry sergeant stops his blade's progress and
looks up at the limey lieutenant.

STIGLITZ
I don't look calm to you?

LT. HICOX
Well, now you put it like that, I guess you do.
He turns his attention back to his blade.
Hicox moves over to Aldo and asks him privately:

LT. HICOX
This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
Not exactly the loquacious type,
is he?
Aldo just looks at him.

LT. ALDO
Is that the kinda man you need, the loquacious
type?

LT. HICOX
Fair point, Lieutenant.

LT. ALDO
So y'all git in trouble in there,
what are we supposed to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?

LT. HICOX
If we get into trouble, we can
handle it. But if trouble does
happen, we need you to make damn
sure no Germans or French, for that matter—
escape from that basement.
If Fraulein von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.
Donny chimes in:

SGT. DONOWITZ
Speaking of Fraulein von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the death trap rendezvous?

LT. HICOX
She chose the spot.

SGT. DONOWITZ
Well, isn't that just dandy?

LT. HICOX
Look, she's not a military strategist. She's
just an actress.

LT. ALDO
Ya don't got to be Stonewall
Jackson to know you don't want to
fight in a basement.

LT. HICOX
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place isolated
and without Germans.

PFC. HIRSCHBERG
Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
but I got me a Nazi pissin' on
Louisiana two o'clock.
They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
PRIVATE relieves himself against the side wall.
Lt. Hicox, this was definitely not the plan.

LT. HICOX
Shit.
Sgt. Donowitz chides him:

SGT. DONOWITZ
So what do you think your Fraulein
von Hammer—

LT. HICOX
—Obviously, I don't know, Sergeant.
The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not
supposed to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
window, Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
in hand.

STIGLITZ
If we're going, let's go.
He sheaths the dagger.

EXT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE sloppily finishes his task.
Cramming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
that lead him back into the basement tavern. We follow him . . .

INT—LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)—NIGHT
Inside the basement tavern La Louisiane. It has a very low-hanging
basement ceiling. A old-looking wood bar off to the right. And the
only other space in the little tavern is taken
up by two large (at least in here) tables, which take up both
halves of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of the
two tables is completely filled with drunken, celebrating
Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
five.

FIVE NAZIS
ONE GERMAN MASTER SERGEANT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SERGEANT (a
powerfully built, stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN SOLDIERS.
The five Nazis are sitting around the table, drinking, and
playing a very fun game with none other than the Fraulein of
the hour, UFA diva BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK, dressed to the
nines in a chic, forties-style woman's suit, complete with fedora.
The game they're playing consists of each player having
a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
out who they are.
The five Germans' five cards read: MASTER SGT #1: (POLA NEGRI);

FEMALE SGT #2: (BEETHOVEN); GERMAN PRIVATE #3: (MATA HARI);

GERMAN PRIVATE #4: (EDGAR WALLACE); GERMAN PRIVATE #5:
(WINNETOU). And Bridget von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
It's German #5's (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN and SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH.

WINNETOU
. . . okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
The whole table bursts out laughing.

FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN
Yes, you are!

EDGAR WALLACE
Well, not really.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
What do you mean, not really? Of
course he is.

EDGAR WALLACE
Well, if he's so American, how come
he's never been translated into
English. He's not American. He's supposed to be
American, but he's not
an American creation. In fact, he's something
very different.

WINNETOU
Okay, I'm a fictional, literary character, from
the past. I'm American, and that's
controversial.

BRIDGET/GENGUS
No, it's not controversial. The nationality of
the author has nothing to do with
the nationality of the character.
The character is the character.
Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
So, yes, this character was born in
America.

WINNETOU
Well, I'm glad that's settled. If I had a wife,
would she be called a squaw?
He's got it.
The table laughs.

THE TABLE

YES!

WINNETOU
Is my blood brother Old Shatterhand?

THE TABLE
Yes!

WINNETOU
Did Karl May write me?

THE TABLE
Yes!
In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE our three counterfeit German
officers—Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz—enter the basement
tavern. They obviously see the five German soldiers, but they're
too far away for us (the audience) to read their faces. No
doubt they're less than happy. Frauhlein von Hammersmark
sees them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.

BRIDGET
Hello, my lovelies. I will join you
in moments. I'm finishing up a game
with my five new friends here.

LT. HICOX
No hurry, Fraulein von Hammersmark.
Take your time. Enjoy yourself.

BRIDGET
(to Winnetou)
So who are you?

WINNETOU
I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
The table CHEERS and APPLAUDS the Apache chief as he takes the card
off his forehead.
The other four German soldiers drink down their beer (part of
the game).
Bridget von Hammersmark knocks back her champagne.

MATA HARI
Fraulein von Hammersmark, when your friends
came in, did you realize
you did a double take, like in the movies?

BRIDGET
Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
at all.

MATA HARI
They must be second nature to you now. Did they
teach you how to do a double take in the
movies?

BRIDGET
Well, yes, they did, but it's not really that
difficult.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
Do one for us.
The table heartily agrees.
Bridget looks directly at the master sergeant and does a perfect,
and perfectly funny, double take.
The table loves it.

MATA HARI
My turn, I want to try.
Mata Hari looks directly at Beethoven and does a double
take.

EDGAR WALLACE
I want to try.
He does.
Soon the whole table is doing dueling double takes.

HICOX—WICKI—STIGLITZ
watch the table do dueling double takes. Obviously, they don't
understand.

THEN . . .
Bridget von Hammersmark rises and excuses herself from the
table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
the name for the first time. Genghis Khan.

BRIDGET
Genghis Khan! I would never have gotten that.
She walks over and joins the masquerading Germans' table. The
gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a French cheek
kiss, as if she knows them well.
They all take a seat. The two basterds and one Brit drink whiskey.
The tavern's PROPRIETOR, an older, big-bellied
Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table and pours more
champagne into Bridget's champagne glass. He leaves, returning back
behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
person in the establishment.
Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

LT. HICOX
I thought this place was supposed to have more
French than Germans?

BRIDGET
Normally that's true. The sergeant over there's
wife just had a baby. His commanding officer
gave him and his
mates the night off to celebrate.

WICKI
We should leave.

BRIDGET
No, we should stay. For one drink at least.
I've been waiting for you in a bar. It would
look strange if we left before we had a drink.

LT. HICOX
She's right. Just be calm, and enjoy your
booze.

BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
The French barmaid has taken Bridget's place in the rousing, rowdy
game. She tells them her person must be French or she
won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
name on a card. The barmaid puts it on her forehead. It says:

NAPOLEON.
The Germans all laugh.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS' TABLE

BRIDGET
There's been some new developments.
The cinema venue has changed.

LT. HICOX
Why?

BRIDGET
No one knows. But that in itself shouldn't be a
problem. The cinema
it's been changed to is considerably smaller
than The Ritz. So whatever materials you
brought for The Ritz should be doubly effective
here.
Now this next piece of information
is colossal, try not to overreact.
The Fuhrer will be attending tomorrow.
Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT-TAKE.
Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
They see Hugo do the spit-take and burst out laughing.
Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit-takes, like they
did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
get wet.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS

BRIDGET
(to Hicox)
You'll be going as Ernst Schuller. You'll say
you're an associate producer on Riefenstahl's
"Tiefland." It's the
one German production not under Goebbels'
control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead at a
Goebbels film affair.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
Master Sgt. Pola Negri drinks his beer as he looks over, dreamily,
at Bridget von Hammersmark at the other table.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. We see in
the B.G. the German master sergeant stand up from his table and
head toward Fraulein von Hammersmark.

BRIDGET
. . . the film's gone through many delays, and
Leni's health is deteriorating, so if you have
to speak . . .
Hicox, seeing the German master sergeant approach, signals for her
to cool it.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
Fraulein von Hammersmark, I was just thinking,
could you sign an autograph
to my son on his birthday?

BRIDGET
I'd love to, Wilhelm.
(to the table)
This handsome happy sergeant just became a
father today.
The pretend officers offer congratulations to the sergeant.
The German master sergeant CLICKS his heels and bows before his
superior officers.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you. Heil Hitler.
He raises his hand . . . as do the seated phony officers: "Heil
Hitler."
As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch . . .

BRIDGET
So, Wilhelm, do you know the name of this
progeny yet?

SGT. POLA NEGRI
I most certainly do, Fraulein. His
name is Maximilian.
Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz likes this German sergeant.

STIGLITZ
Wonderful name, Sergeant.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old enough to
ride a bicycle, I will buy
him a blue one. And I will paint on
the side "The Blue Max."
He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheer.
They do.
Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

BRIDGET
There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
She reaches into her clutch and pulls out some lipstick,
applies some ruby-red color to her lips, and then kisses the
napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then she hands the treasured
item to the young officer.

BRIDGET
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Fraulein, thank you. Max may not
know who you are now. But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films,
and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern . . .

SGT. POLA NEGRI
I propose a toast to the greatest actress in
Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no
Riefenstahl, only von Hammersmark!
The whole room toasts.
This would be a good time for the German sergeant to go back to his
table and his men. And he almost does . . . but . . . since he is
drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
So, Fraulein von Hammersmark, what brings you
to France?
Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would have been
exhausted long ago, Lt. Hicox butts in.

LT. HICOX
None of your business, Sergeant.
You might not have worn out your welcome with
the fraulein with your drunken, boorish
behavior, but you have worn out your welcome
with me.
The table of game-playing soldiers hears this and gets quiet.

LT. HICOX
Might I remind you Sergeant, you're an enlisted man.
This is an officers' table. I suggest
you stop pestering the fraulein and
rejoin your table.
The German master sergeant looks quizzically at the officer.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
Excuse me, Captain, but your accent is very
unusual.
The whole room pauses . . . for different reasons . . .

SGT. POLA NEGRI
Where are you from?
A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two German-
born imposters spring into action.

WICKI
Sergeant! You must be either drunk or mad to
speak to a superior officer with
such impertinence!
Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table:

STIGLITZ
I'm making YOU . . .
(pointing at
Winnetou)
. . . and YOU . . .
(pointing at
Edgar Wallace)
. . . responsible for him.
(pointing at
Sgt. Pola)
I suggest you take hold of your friend, or
he'll spend Max's first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness!
The Germans SPRING UP and take hold of Sgt. Pola . . .

WHEN . . .
A GERMAN VOICE rings out:

GERMAN VOICE (OS)
Then might I inquire?
The five known Germans move aside, revealing the unknown German
in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before:
MAJOR DIETER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The major stands from
the little table he was sitting at.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Like the young, newly christened father, I to
have an acute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Captain?
Wicki jumps in:

WICKI
Major, this is highly inappr—

MAJOR HELLSTROM
—I wasn't speaking to you,
Lieutenant Saltzberg,
(turning to
Stiglitz)
or you either, Lieutenant Berlin.
(looking at
Hicox)
I was speaking to Captain I-don't-know-what.
The Gestapo major is now standing beside Sgt. Pola, before the
imposter's table.
Lt. Hicox calmly explains his origin.

LT. HICOX
I was born in the village that rests
in the shadow of Pitz Palu.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
The mountain?

LT. HICOX
Yes. In that village we all speak like this.
Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes.

LT. HICOX
Then you saw me. You remember the skiing torch
scene?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes, I do.

LT. HICOX
In that scene were myself, my father,
my sister, and my two brothers. My brother is
so handsome, the director, Pabst, gave him a
closeup.
As Bridget von Hammersmark places a cigarette in an ivory cigarette
holder—which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her
she says:

BRIDGET
Major, if my word means anything, I can vouch
for everything the young captain has just said.
He does hail from the bottom of Pitz Palu, he
was in the film, and his brother is far more
handsome than he.
The imposters laugh.
Then . . . so does the Gestapo major. He turns to the sergeant.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
You should rejoin your friends.
Which the young sergeant is more than happy to do. That table
begins playing their game again.
Major Hellstrom, the highest-ranking officer in the room, bows
graciously to the female German celebrity.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
May I join you?

BRIDGET
By all means, Major.
The Gestapo major sits at the table, opposite Lt. Hicox and Wicki.
The French barmaid brings over the Major's beer stein.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
So that's the source of your bizarre accent?
Extraordinary. So what are
you doing here, Captain?

LT. HICOX
Aside from having a drink with the lovely
fraulein?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, that pleasure requires no explanation.
Chuckle . . . chuckle

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I mean in country. You're obviously not
stationed in France, or I'd know who
you are.

LT. HICOX
You know every German in France?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Worth knowing.

LT. HICOX
Well, therein lies the problem. We
never claimed to be worth knowing.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
(chuckling as
he asks)
All levity aside, what are you doing
in France?

LT. HICOX
Attending Goebbels's film premiere as
the fraulein's escort.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
You're the fraulein's escort?

LT. HICOX
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.

BRIDGET
The captain is my date, but all three are my
guests. We're old friends, Major, who go back a
long time. Longer than
an actress would care to admit.
Chuckle . . . chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass to the
three luckiest men in the room.

BRIDGET
I'll drink to that.
They cheers.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS' TABLE
They continue to have a lot of fun playing their game.

BACK TO THE OFFICERS' TABLE

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I must say, that game they're playing
looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't
join them, because you're quite right, Captain,
officers and enlisted men shouldn't
fraternize. But seeing as we're all
officers here,
(bowing to
Bridget)
. . . and sophisticated lady friends of
officers, what say we play the game?
Lt. Hicox begins to refuse when Bridget (feeling she knows better)
interrupts him:

BRIDGET
Okay, one game.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Wunderbar.
The major borrows five cards from the other table and lays
them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
So the object of the game is to write
the name of a famous person on your card. Real
or fictitious, doesn't matter. For instance,
you could write Confucius or
Fu Manchu.
(He SNAPS his fingers.)
Eric! More pens.
(back to the players)
And they must be famous. No Aunt Ingas. When
you finish writing, put the card face down on
the table and move it to the person to your
left. The person to your right will move their
card in
front of you. You pick up the card without
looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on
your forehead, like so.
He demonstrates.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
(con't)
And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess
who you are . . .
As Maj. Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
game, a CAMERA PANS OFF HIM and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
STIGLITZ. The major's dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
Until we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED-FILTERED
FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a
GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSEUP.
The flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being
this close to a Gestapo uniform and not plunging a knife into
it.
The major's voice comes back on the soundtrack.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
. . . So let's give it a try, shall we?
Everybody write your names.
The five players write their names . . .
Then move their cards to the left . . .
Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead . . .

MAJOR BRIDGET WILHELM ARCHIE HUGO

HELLSTROM VON HAMMERSMARK WICKI HICOX STIGLITZ
is is is is is

KING G.W. BULLDOG BRIGITTE MARCO

KONG PABST DRUMMOND HELM POLO

MAJ. KING KONG
I'll start, give you the idea.
Am I German?
They laugh.

BRIDGET
No.

MAJ. KING KONG
Am I an American?
They laugh—but then Wicki says:

WICKI
Wait a minute, he goes to—

BRIDGET
Don't be ridiculous. Obviously he wasn't born
in America.

MAJ. KING KONG
So . . . I visited America, aye?
The table says, "Yes."

MAJ. KING KONG
Was this visit . . . fortuitous?

WICKI
Not for you.

MAJ. KING KONG
. . . Hummm. My native land, is it what one
would call exotic?
The table confers and decides, yes, it is exotic.

MAJ. KING KONG
Hummm. That could be either a reference to the
jungle or the Orient. I'm going to let my first
instinct take over and ask, am I from the
jungle?
The table says, "Yes, you are."

MAJ. KING KONG
Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask
whether you're real or fictitious.
I, however, think that's too easy, so I won't
ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the
jungle. I visited America, but my visit was not
fortuitous to me, but the implication is that
it was to somebody else. When I went from the
jungle to America, . . . did I go by boat?
"Yes."

MAJ. KING KONG
Did I go against my will?
"Yes."

MAJ. KING KONG
On this boat ride . . . Was I in chains?
"Yes."

MAJ. KING KONG
When I arrived in America . . . was I displayed
in chains?
"Yes."

MAJ. KING KONG
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
The table says, "No."

MAJ. KING KONG
Well, then, I must be King Kong.
He throws the card on the table.
They applaud him.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now since I answered correctly, you all need to
finish your drinks.
The three counterfeit Nazis knock back their whiskeys.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now, who's next?

LT. HICOX
Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the four of
us are very good friends. And the four of us
haven't seen each other in quite a while. So .
Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I beg to differ, Captain. It's only if the
fraulein considers my presence an
intrusion that I become an intruder.
How about it, Fraulein? Am I intruding?

BRIDGET
Of course not, Major.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I didn't think so. It's simply the young
captain is immune to my charms.
The table's not sure what to do. Is this a confrontation?
Then the major laughs.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I'm just joking. Of course, I'm intruding.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Allow me to refill your glasses, gentlemen, and
I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.
(leaning in)
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three-year-old
single-malt scotch whiskey from the Scottish
highlands. What do you say, gentlemen?

LT. HICOX
You're most gracious, sir.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Eric, the thirty-three and new glasses! You
don't want to contaminate the thirty-three with
the swill you were drinking.

ERIC
How many glasses?

LT. HICOX
Five glasses.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn't like me.

BRIDGET
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Lt. Hicox holds up three fingers (pinky to middle finger) to Eric,
the owner.

LT. HICOX
Three glasses.
Eric brings the three glasses and the old bottle, pouring for
the three soldiers.
Major Hellstrom lifts up his beer stein and toasts:

MAJOR HELLSTROM
To a thousand-year Reich!
They all mutter, "a thousand-year reich" and clink glasses.
The Gestapo major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
CLICK under the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Did you hear that? That's the sound of
my WALTER pointed right at your testicles.

LT. HICOX
Why do you have a Luger pointed at my
testicles?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Because you've just given yourself
away, captain. You're no more German than
scotch.

LT. HICOX
Well, Major—

BRIDGET
—Major—

MAJOR HELLSTROM
—Shut up, slut.
(to Hicox)
You were saying?

LT. HICOX
I was saying that makes two of us. I've had a
gun pointed at your balls since you sat down.

SGT. STIGLITZ
That makes three of us.

UNDER THE TABLE
We see all three guns pointed at the appropriate crotches, as well
as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi major's. Her pretty
gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.

SGT. STIGLITZ
And at this range, I'm a real
Fredrick Zoller.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Hummm . . . Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.

LT. HICOX
What's going to happen, Major, is you're going
to stand up and walk out that
door with us.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't think so. I'm
afraid you and I both know, no matter what
happens to anybody else in this room, the two of
us aren't going anywhere.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
(pointing at the table
behind him)
Too bad about Sgt. Wilhelm and his friends.
If any of you expect to live, you'll have to shoot
them too.
(pause)
Looks like little Max is going to grow up an
orphan. How sad.

BRIDGET
Then, Major, I implore you. For the
sake of those German troops, will
you please leave with us?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Oh, Bridget, your concern for German troops
gets me . . .
(pointing at
his heart)
. . . right here. You mean for the sake of your
whore legs, don't you? You can't afford to get
any bullet holes in them. You're not finished
spreading them for all the Hollywood Jews.
Lt. Hicox picks up his thirty-three-year-old single-malt
scotch and says:

LT. HICOX

(ENGLISH)
Well, if this is it, old boy, I hope
you don't mind if I go out speaking
the king's?

MAJOR HELLSTROM

(ENGLISH)
By all means, Captain.
The English film critic commando picks up the thirty-three
the Nazi major bought him and says:

LT. HICOX
There's a special rung in hell reserved for
people who waste good scotch.
And seeing as I might be rapping on
the door momentarily . . .
He downs the stuff.

LT. HICOX
(to the Nazi
major)
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.
He puts the glass down.

LT. HICOX
Now about this pickle we find
ourselves in. It would appear there's only one
thing left for you to do.

MAJOR HELLSTROM

(ENGLISH)
And what would that be?

LT. HICOX
Stiglitz.

STIGLITZ
Say, "auf Widersehen" to your balls!

STIGLITZ
FIRES into HELLSTROM'S BALLS . . .
As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as
well.

HELLSTROM
FIRES into HICOX's BALLS and KNEECAPS.

STIGLITZ
then JUMPS over the table and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the

DAGGER.
HICOX FALLS to the floor . . . DEAD.
BRIDGET FALLS to the floor . . . SHOT.

WICKI
brings his weapon out from underneath the table and BEGINS
FIRING across at the GERMANS at the table, who, unaware, were still

PLAYING THE GAME.

WINNETOU
is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knows what is happening.
EDGAR WALLACE is SHOT by WICKI.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
FALLS to the floor in the confusion.
FEMALE SGT. BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each
other and FIRE. They BOTH TAKE and GIVE each other so many BULLETS
it's almost romantic when they collapse DEAD on the
floor.
WICKI and MATA HARI
both ON THEIR FEET, FIRING WILDLY at each other. MATA HARI is
HIT THREE TIMES. WICKI is HIT ONCE.

SGT. POLA NEGRI
comes off the floor with a SUBMACHINE GUN and SPRAYS the
whole other side of the room, WIPING OUT WICKI, ERIC, MATA HARI,
and THE BARMAID.
The SHOOTING STOPS . . . THE SMOKE caused by the gunfire . . .
starts to DISSIPATE . . . The only one in the room left alive is
the
young German sergeant with the machine gun.
WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside reach the basement
entrance.
The door opens . . .
The German sergeant sends FIFTY BULLETS in the door's
direction . . .
No one goes through it.
What we have here is a rabbit-hole-like situation. No one
inside is getting out. No one outside is getting in.
The young German sergeant YELLS in ENGLISH to the outside:

GERMAN SERGEANT
You outside! Who are you? British, American,
what?
Aldo's voice YELLS down the hole:

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
We're Americans! What are you?

GERMAN SERGEANT
I'm a German, you idiot!

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
You speak English pretty good for a German!

GERMAN SERGEANT
I agree! So let's talk!

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Okay, talk!

GERMAN SERGEANT
I'm a father! My baby was born today
in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max!
We were in here drinking and celebrating!
They're the ones that
came in shooting and killing!
It's not my fault!

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Okay, okay, it wasn't your fault!
What's your name, soldier?

GERMAN SERGEANT
Wilhelm!

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
That's the same name as one of the
guys you just killed!

WILHELM
They attacked us!

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm . . . is anybody alive
on our side?

WILHELM
No!
We hear a VOICE OFFSCREEN yell out:

BRIDGET'S VOICE (OS)
I'm alive!
Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.
On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the still-alive
Bridget von Hammersmark.
The German sergeant points the muzzle of the machine gun at
the German celebrity, with hate in his eyes.

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Who's that?

WILHELM
(to BRIDGET,
low)
Make a sound, whore, and I spit!
Meaning the muzzle.

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Wilhelm, who is that?

WILHELM
Is the girl on your side?
Pause.

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Which girl?

WILHELM
Who do you think—von Hammersmark!

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Yeah, she's ours!

WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
I thought so. So you run with the Americans
now, huh? Now times are
bad?

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Is she okay?

WILHELM
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
You despicable traitor.
(to Aldo)
She's been shot, but she's alive.
(to Bridget,
LOW, in GERMAN)
For now.
We hear the Basterds curse their luck offscreen.

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Wilhelm, what'd ya say we
make a deal?

WILHELM
What's your name?

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call ya Willi?

WILHELM
Yes.

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
So, Willi, you know we could lob three or four
or five or six grenades down there and your
little war story ends here. But good fer you,
bad fer her.
You die, she dies. So what say we
make a swap?

WILLI
Keep talking!

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Okay, Willi, here's my deal! You let
me and one of my men come down to
take the girl away! And we take the
girl and leave! That simple, Willi!
You go your way, we go ours! And little Max
gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy!
So what 'ya say, Willi, we got a deal?
Willi thinks . . .
Bridget watches Willi think . . .

WILLI
Aldo?

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
I'm here, Willi!

WILLI
I want to trust you . . . But how can I?

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
What choice ya got?

WILLI
I could kill the girl!

ALDO'S VOICE (OS)
Well, now, Willi, that's true enough. But
something you need to know, so
you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't
none of us give a fuck 'bout that
girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
her, it would fuck up our plans. But you'll be
dead by then anyway, so
what'd you care? And let's not
forget that little Katzenjammer
Max, growin' up without a pop. So in
the spirit of gettin' you home to
him, we got a deal, Willi?

WILLI
Okay, Aldo. I'm going to trust you!
Come down, no guns!
Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
Willi keeps his machine gun trained on them.
Aldo, with his hands up, says:

ALDO
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine
gun? I thought we had a deal.

WILLI
We do have a deal. Now get the girl
and go.

ALDO
Not so fast, Willi. We only have a
deal, we trust each other. A Mexican standoff
ain't trust.

WILLI
You need guns on me for it to be
a Mexican standoff.

ALDO
You got guns on us, you decide to
shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got grenades,
they drop 'em down here, you're dead. That's a
Mexican
standoff, and that wasn't the deal.

WILLI
Just take that fuckin' traitor and
go! See? Now you're down here—
Now you get tricky—!

ALDO
—No tricks!—Ain't nobody gittin'
tricky, Willi! I swear to god, I'm
too damn dumb to get tricky. But
(meaning
Hirschberg)
him and I lived up to the deal. We
came down without guns. Now it's
your turn. No trust, no deal.
Willi pointing the gun at them . . . thinking . . .

ALDO
I know you're scared. I'm scared,
he's scared, we're all scared.
So what's it gonna be, Willi?
Either we got a deal or you might
as well just shoot us now.
Willi decides . . .
He puts the machine gun down on the bar.

WILLI
Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
get her out of my sight.

ALDO
Danke, Willi, danke. Okay, Hirschberg, you grab
her shoulder—

WHEN . . .
From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major Hellstrom's
WALTER and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
Sgt. Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
Aldo and Hirschberg spin around, shocked.
From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excruciating pain
(she'll probably lose that leg) German movie star says to the
two American soldiers she's just meeting for the first time:

BRIDGET
He was an enemy soldier who knew who
I was. He couldn't live.

INT—FRENCH HOUSE IN COUNTRY (BEDROOM)—NIGHT
An OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his
bed, in his bedroom . . .

WHEN . . .
. . . . OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN . . .
. . . . . The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING . . .
and the sound of FEET RUNNING TOWARD US . . .
his bedroom door is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt. Donowitz RUSHES
IN, grabbing the old man in his bed and putting a
.45 automatic to his head.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Doctor?

OLD MAN

(FRENCH)
What? What's happening?
Donny SLAMS the .45 hard against the old man's head, shocking,
scaring, and bringing the old gent to attention.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
He nods his head, yes.

SGT. DONOWITZ
Andiamo . . .
Donny YANKS/DRAGS the old man out of bed, in his almost
comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality
against him hurts more) toward the door . . .

INT—DOCTOR'S EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
. . . Into a doctor's examining room built into a French country
house, with an examining table and medical instruments.
However, it's obviously the medical examining room
of a veterinarian.
Along the walls are different cages with eight BARKING
dogs in them.
The soldiers are putting the shot-in-the-leg, bleeding, and in
excruciating pain Bridget on the examining table.
Donny, still holding onto the Old Man, points in the girl's
direction . . .

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)
She's been shot. Shot. Bang, bang . . .
(pointing at
his leg)
. . . in leg . . . understand?

OLD MAN

(FRENCH)
No, no, no, I don't speak English.
Donny jams the barrel of his .45 into the thigh of the old man.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)
BANG, BANG—in the leg, understand!
The old man nods his head, yes.

OLD MAN

(FRENCH)
But I'm a veterinarian . . . animals . . .
I take care of animals . . .
Bridget screams from the table . . .

BRIDGET

(ENGLISH)
He's a fucking veterinarian, you imbecile!

SGT. DONOWITZ
He's still a doctor. If he can get
a bullet out of a cow, he can get
a bullet outta you.

LT. ALDO
Right now, we just need morphine.
Donny yells at the old man:

SGT. DONOWITZ
Morphine! We need morphine!
The old man tries to explain in French that he's not a human doctor
Donny takes the .45 and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the
cages.
Everybody jumps.
Donny SCREAMS at the old man:

SGT. DONOWITZ

MORPHINE!

BANG
He SHOOTS another dog . . .

SGT. DONOWITZ

MORPHINE!
The old man begs him to stop and goes to get the morphine.

CUT TO
The BODY of Gestapo Major DIETER HELLSTROM dead on the floor.

INT—LA LOUISIANE—NIGHT
We're back in the basement tavern. Col. Hans Landa stands
over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, and a smile
breaks out on his face.
He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
Ahhh, Hugo, you've moved up in the world, I
see. Lieutenant. And with
your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.
A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN joins the S.S. officer.

COL. LANDA
And that one's . . .
(pointing at
Wicki)
. . . name is Wilhelm Wicki. He's an Austrian-
born Jew who immigrated
to the United States when things
began turning sour for the Israelites. They are
the two German-born members of the Basterds.
They've been known
to don German uniforms to ambush squads.

FLASH ON
three Nazi soldiers walking toward a company of other German
soldiers. The three soldiers' back are to us. Dried, bloody bullet
holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
The SERGEANT of the German company yells to the trio:

SGT. GERMAN COMPANY
What brings you all the way out here?
The TRIO NOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine guns.

BACK TO LANDA

COL. LANDA
But that doesn't look like this.
This is odd.
Looking down he sees something . . .
Bending down, he examines Fraulein von Hammersmark's two
pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
One shoe is covered in blood.
The other, while blood-speckled, is fairly clean.
Picking up the clean shoe and holding it in his hand.

COL. LANDA
It would appear somebody's missing. Somebody
fashionable.
AN OFFSCREEN SOLDIER'S VOICE cries out:

SOLDIERS VOICE (OS)
Colonel, this one's still alive!
We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt. Willi lies. He's
shot in the chest, but it looks like Max's daddy is still alive.

INT—EXAMINING ROOM—NIGHT
Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the
German lady.

LT. ALDO
Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need
to answer a few questions.

BRIDGET
Few questions about what?

LT. ALDO
About I got three men dead back there, and why
don't you try tellin' us what the fuck
happened?

BRIDGET
The British officer blew his German
act, and a Gestapo major saw it.

LT. ALDO
'Fore we get into who shot John,
Why did you invite my men to a
rendezvous in a basement with a bunch
of Nazis?

BRIDGET
I can see, since you didn't see
what happened inside, the Nazis
being there must look odd.

LT. ALDO
Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
odd in English. It's called
suspicious.

BRIDGET
Don't let your imagination get the better of
you, Lieutenant. You met
the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight. His
commanding officer gave
him and his friends the night off to celebrate.
The Germans being there
was just a tragic coincidence.
Aldo thinks for a moment . . .

LT. ALDO
Okay, I'll buy that. He was either
there with his men waiting for us,
or he was there celebrating his
son's birthday. He wasn't doin' both.

LT. ALDO
How did the shootin' start?

BRIDGET
The English man gave himself away.

LT. ALDO
How did he do that?

BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, middle to pinky.

BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, thumb to middle.

BRIDGET
This is the German three. The other
is odd. Germans would and did notice it.

LT. ALDO
Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans, and
everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to. What would of been
the next step?

BRIDGET
Tuxedoes. To get them into the
premiere wearing military uniforms,
with all the military there, would
have been suicide. But going as
members of the German film industry,
they wear tuxedoes and blend in with everybody
else. I arranged a tailor
to fit three tuxedoes tonight.

LT. ALDO
How did you intend to get them into
the premiere?

BRIDGET
Hand me my purse.
They do. And she opens it and takes out three tickets to the
film premiere.

BRIDGET
Lt. Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German cameraman
and his assistant.

LT. ALDO
Can you still get us into that
premiere?

BRIDGET
Can you speak German better than your friends?
No. Have I been shot? Yes.
I don't see me tripping the light fantastic up
the red carpet anytime
soon. Least of all by tomorrow
night.
(pause)
However, there's something you don't know.
There's been two recent developments regarding
Operation
Kino. One, the venue has been
changed from The Ritz to a much
smaller venue.

LT. ALDO
Enormous changes at the last minute? That's not
very Germanic. Why the
hell is Goebbels doin' stuff so damn peculiar?

BRIDGET
It probably has something to do with
the second development.

LT. ALDO
Which is?

FLASH ON
IN A PRIVATE DINING ROOM IN GERMANY, the FUHRER, aka Adolf Hitler,
aka Adolf Shicklegroover, aka the Bohemian Corporal, having dinner
with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.

THE FUHRER

(GERMAN)
I've been rethinking my position in regards to
your Paris premiere of "Nation's Pride." As the
weeks have
gone on and the Americans are on
the beach, I do find myself thinking
more and more about this Private
Zoller. This boy has done something tremendous
for us. And I'm beginning
to think my participation in this
event could be meaningful.

BACK TO BRIDGET

BRIDGET
The Fuhrer's attending the premiere.
Donny breaks the team's silence:

SGT. DONOWITZ
What?

LT. ALDO
When the hell did this happen?

BRIDGET
The venue change, two weeks ago.
The Fuhrer's attendance, four days
ago.

LT. ALDO
And how come London don't know
nothing about that?

BRIDGET
We need to get something straight,
once and for all. Everything London knows, it
learned from me. If I
don't know, London doesn't know.
So now, this is me, informing you, Hitler's
coming to Paris.

SGT. DONOWITZ

FUCK A DUCK!
Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
information.

BRIDGET
What are you thinking?

LT. ALDO
I'm thinking getting a wack at
plantin' ole Uncle Adolph makes
this a horse of a different color.

BRIDGET
What's that supposed to mean?

LT. ALDO
It means you're gettin' us into that premiere.

BRIDGET
I'm going to probably end up losing
this leg, bye bye, acting career,
fun while it lasted. How do you
expect me to walk up a red carpet?

LT. ALDO
The doggie doc's gonna dig that slug outta your
gam. Then he's gonna wrap
it up in a cast, and you gotta good
"how I broke my leg mountain climbing" story.
That's German, ain't it?
Y'all like climbin' mountains,
don't cha?

BRIDGET
I don't. I like smoking, drinking,
and ordering in restaurants, but I
see your point.

LT. ALDO
We fill ya up with morphine, till
it's comin out ya ears. Then just
limp your little ass up that
rouge car-pet.

BRIDGET
Splendid. When the Nazis put me up against a
wall, it won't hurt
so much.
(changing tone)
I know this is a silly question
before I ask it, but can you
Americans speak any other language
than English?

HIRSCHBERG
Other than Yiddish?

BRIDGET
Preferably.
Donny, referring to Aldo and himself:

SGT. DONOWITZ
We both speak a little Italian.

BRIDGET
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us
in the crib. Germans don't have a
good ear for Italian. So you mumble Italian and
brazen through it, is
that the plan?

LT. ALDO
That's about it.

BRIDGET
That sounds good.

LT. ALDO
It sounds like shit, but what else
we gonna do, go home?

BRIDGET
No, it's good. If you don't blow it
with that, I can get you in the building.
(changes tone)
So, who does what?

LT. ALDO
Well, I speak the most Italian, so
I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
the second most, so he'll be your Italian
cameraman. And Hirschberg
third most, so he'll be Donny's assistant.

HIRSCHBERG
I don't speak Italian.

LT. ALDO
Like I said, third best. Just keep
your fuckin' mouth shut. In fact, why don't you
start practicing right now.

BRIDGET
(meaning Utivich)
What about the little one?

UTIVICH
Do you mean me?

BRIDGET
I didn't mean any offense.

UTIVICH
None taken, you German cunt.

LT. ALDO
Utivich is the chauffeur.

UTIVICH
I can't drive.
Bridget SCREAMS in frustration:

BRIDGET
You Americans are fucking useless!

UTIVICH
Gimmie a break. I'm from Manhattan.

LT. ALDO
No worries, son. We got over fourteen hours
before the movie tomorrow.
More than enough time for you to learn to
drive.

UTIVICH
No, no, no, no, Lieutenant, it's not!

LT. ALDO
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, Private, it is. And
yes, yes, yes, you will.
(changes tone)
Look, Utivich, you and I both know,
if we went to grade school together,
you damn sure ain't copyin' off of my test.
Well, I lernt to drive in four hours on a
Tennessee mountain road.
And I'm a shit-for-brains coal miner
bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
to drive, right?

HIRSCHBERG
Yes.

LT. ALDO
Teach 'im.

BRIDGET
But there is a problem. I'm a movie star. This
is a movie premiere.
I can't show up looking like I was
just in a Nazi gunfight. Now I
have a dress for the premiere at my hotel. But
sometime tomorrow I
have to get my hair done.
All the Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.

LT. ALDO
Sister, you must got wunderbar luck. Guess who
went to beauty school?
The CAMERA WHIP-PANS to SGT. DONOWITZ.
Bridget rolls her eyes.

BLACK FRAME

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER FIVE

"REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE"

FADE OFF

INT—SHOSANNA AND MARCEL'S LIVING QUARTERS—NIGHT
We're in Shosanna and Marcel's living quarters above the
cinema. We've never been in here before.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS ONSCREEN:

"NIGHT OF 'NATION'S PRIDE' PREMIERE"
Shosanna's standing before a full-length mirror in a real
attractive forties-style dress for the premiere. She's stunning.
This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity
or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
SOUNDS of the hubbub of the premiere, not to mention the
German brass band that's blaring Third Reich marches, can be heard
coming from below.
Shosanna walks to her apartment window and looks down at the
Germanic miasma below.

SHOSANNA'S POV
WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of SPECTATORS. Tons of guests
dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedoes, and female finery, walking up
the long red carpet (with a big swastika in the middle, naturally)
leading into Shosanna's cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing
away. German radio and film crews covering the event for the
fatherland back home. And, of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS
providing security for this joyous Germanic occasion.
Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi and HOCKS it.
A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR—the
lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
Shosanna goes back to the full-length mirror, places a very
fashionable forties-style hat on her head, then lowers the period-
style black fishnet veil over her face. She takes out
a small GUN and puts it in the pocket of her dress, and it's
on. She exits the apartment door to join the premiere.
From this point on, there's no turning back. It's all the way baby,
all the fucking way!

INT—CINEMA STAIRWELL—NIGHT
The stairwell in the building that connects the living
quarters with the cinema. Shosanna walks down the stairs and goes
through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door. She
takes out a key and opens it.

INT—PROJECTION BOOTH—NIGHT
Marcel's prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
three, our specially marked can for reel four, and the can for
reel five (which should never see the light of a projector)
lie in wait.
Shosanna, looking like a forties movie star, enters the projection
booth.
The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

MARCEL
Ooh la la, Danielle Darrieux, this
is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.

SHOSANNA
Shut up, fool.
Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face and their lips
meet.

SHOSANNA
Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
down and socialize with these Hun
pigs. Let's go over it again?

MARCEL
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second. Three
and four are ready to go.

SHOSANNA
Okay, the big sniper battle in the
film begins around the middle of
the third reel. Our film comes on
in the fourth reel, so somewhere
toward the end of the third reel,
go down and lock the doors of the auditorium.
Then take your place
behind the screen, and wait for my
CUE when I give it to you: BURN IT DOWN!

INT—CINEMA LOBBY—NIGHT
The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
German beautiful people enter the cinema. They mingle in the
swastika-covered, Greek-nude-statue-peppered lobby. Nazi
military commanders, high-ranking party officials, and German
celebrities (Emil Jannings, Veit Harlan) hobnob and drink Champagne
from passing WAITERS, who carry glasses on silver trays.
We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
entrance. She descends the staircase and busies herself with
theater stuff.
At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race in all
their finery, is Col. Hans Landa, dressed in his finest S.S. dress
uniform.

CAMERA FRAME
directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
Col. Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
cinema. On the left side of the frame is the cinema entrance, from
a looking-down perspective of the guests entering the building.

THEN . . .
A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
side of the frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside Landa's
think bubble a little scene plays out.

THINK BUBBLE
A hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col. Landa enters the room and
screams at everybody:

COL. LANDA
I want everybody out of this room!
They start to leave.

COL. LANDA
That means now, goddamnit!
They RUSH OUT.
He walks over to the patient in the hospital bed. It's none
other than SGT. WILLI, and yes, he's still alive.
Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed and sits down.

COL. LANDA
Can you speak, Sergeant?

SGT. WILLI
(weakly)
Yes, Colonel.

COL. LANDA
Tell me everything that happened in there.
The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, revealing the entrance again, and
as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget von Hammersmark, dressed
lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three Basterds in their
tuxedos flank her.

CU COL. LANDA
smiles.
He descends the stairs, toward the four saboteurs . . .
They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
Fraulein von Hammersmark, what
has befallen Germany's most elegant swan?

BRIDGET
Col. Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever, I see.

COL. LANDA
Flattery will get you everywhere, Fraulein.
They chuckle and air kiss.

COL. LANDA
So what's happened to your lovely
leg? A by-product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.

BRIDGET
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former
conquests to fall into that honeypot.
Chuckle . . . chuckle . . .

COL. LANDA
Seriously, what happened?

BRIDGET
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
might add, at mountain climbing.
And this was the result.

COL. LANDA
Mountain climbing? That's how you injured your
leg—mountain climbing?

BRIDGET
Believe it or not, yes, it is.
A brief moment passes between the two . . .

THEN . . .
The colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious, in
fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
The colonel begins to regain his composure . . .

COL. LANDA
Forgive me, Fraulein. I don't mean to laugh at
your misfortune. It's just
. . . mountain climbing? I'm curious, Fraulein,
what could have ever
compelled you to undertake such a foolhardy
endeavor?
The double meaning is not lost on the German actress.

BRIDGET
Well, I shan't be doing it again, I can tell
you that.

COL. LANDA
That cast looks as fresh as my old
Uncle Gustave. When were you climbing this
mountain, last night?

BRIDGET
Very good eye, Colonel. It happened yesterday
morning.

COL. LANDA
Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
is this mountain?
This stops her for a second.
Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.

COL. LANDA
I'm just teasing you, Fraulein. You
know me, I tease rough. So who are
your three handsome escorts?

BRIDGET
I'm afraid neither of the three speak a word of
German. They're friends of
mine from Italy. This is a wonderful Italian
stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
(meaning Aldo)
A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
(meaning Donny)
And Enzo's camera assistant, Dominick Decocco.
The German Fraulein turns to the three tuxedo-wearing
Basterds.

BRIDGET

(ITALIAN)
Gentlemen, this is an old friend, Colonel
Hans Landa of the S.S.
The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is,
but they can't show it.
Aldo sticks out his hand . . .

LT. ALDO
Buongiorno.
The German takes his hand . . .

COL. LANDA
Margheriti . . .

(ITALIAN)
Am I saying it correctly? . . . Margheriti?

LT. ALDO

(ITALIAN)
Yes. Correct.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Margheriti . . . Say it for me once, please . .

LT. ALDO
Margheriti.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)
I'm sorry, again . . . ?

LT. ALDO
Margheriti.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Once more . . .?

LT. ALDO
Margheriti.

COL. LANDA
Margheriti.

(FRENCH)
It means daisies, I believe.
Turning his gaze to Donny.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)
What's your name again?

SGT. DONOWITZ
Enzo Gorlomi.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Again . . . ?

SGT. DONOWITZ
Gorlomi.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)
One more time, but let me really
hear the music in it.

SGT. DONOWITZ

(HAMMY ITALIAN)
Gorlomi.
Now to Hirschberg . . .

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)
And you?
Then Hirschberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the
group:

HIRSCHBERG
Dominick Decocco.

COL. LANDA
Dominick Decocco?

HIRSCHBERG
Dominic Decocco.

COL. LANDA
Bravo . . . Bravo.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
Well, my two cameraman friends need
to find their seats.
Col. Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)
Not so fast. Let's enjoy some champagne.
Everyone gets a glass.

COL. LANDA

(FRENCH)
—Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
join us. I have some friends I'd
like you to meet.
Shosanna joins the circle and is handed a champagne glass.
This is the first moment the Basterds are aware of Shosanna.

COL. LANDA

(FRENCH)
May I say, Mademoiselle, you look divine.

SHOSANNA

(FRENCH)
Merci.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)
This lovely young lady is Mademoiselle
Emmanuelle Mimieux. This is her cinema, and she
is our hostess for the evening.

(FRENCH)
And, Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and
none-worse-for-the-wear German goddess, is
Bridget von Hammersmark.

BRIDGET
Bonjour.

SHOSANNA
Bonjour.

BRIDGET

(FRENCH)
I'm afraid my companions don't speak
any French. They're Italian. This is Antonio,
Enzo, and Dominick.
All three smile goofy, spaghetti-bender smiles.

COL. LANDA

(FRENCH)
Actually, Fraulein von Hammersmark's Italian
associates need help finding their seats.
Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind
as to escort them?

SHOSANNA

(FRENCH)
It would be my pleasure. Let me see
your tickets?
Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
then follow the young French girl into the auditorium.

INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with gray and black
uniforms.
Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
After she points out their seats, she turns to leave . . .
Hirschberg . . .
reaches out and grabs her wrist. . . .
He looks her in the face and, filled with tremendous guilt, because
if he's successful tonight he's going to blow this
cute French girl to smithereens, he says:

HIRSCHBERG
Grazie.
The cute French girl looks back at the goofy-looking Italian
boy with slicked-back hair that makes him look kind of
Jewish with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful tonight,
she's going to burn him alive, and says:

SHOSANNA
Prego.

BACK TO THE LOBBY
They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER

YELLS IN GERMAN:

GERMAN SOLDIER
Take your seats! The show is about to begin!
Everybody take your seats!
Col. Landa, Lt. Aldo, and Bridget are still together.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)
I must call the Fuhrer. He doesn't
want to make his entrance until everybody is
seated. Come with me, Frau von Hammersmark. The
Fuhrer has
heard you're here, and he wishes to commend you
personally.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
Me? Why?

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)
Don't be modest. Everybody is quite taken with
your resolve. An accident like you've just
experienced, and
yet you still show up to an
important party event. The Fuhrer
was quite adamant in his gratitude. We'll use
Mademoiselle Mimieux's office.
(to Aldo
in Italian)
I'm afraid I must rob you of your companion,
but only for a moment.

BRIDGET

(ITALIAN)
Yes, apparently the Fuhrer wishes to commend
me.

COL. LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Wait here a moment. I promise I won't detain
her long.
What are either of them supposed to do, argue?
Col. Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GUARDS/USHERS and whispers
in his ear, guesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying, leave the boy
alone, till we come back . . . Or is he?
Col. Landa limps Bridget away toward Shosanna's office.
As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi guards/ushers
in the now-vacant lobby.

INT—SHOSANNA'S OFFICE—NIGHT
Shosanna's cinema manager's office. It's small, cluttered, and
dominated by a desk.
They both enter.
Col. Landa closes the door behind him and LOCKS IT.
Bridget notices but says nothing.
Now the two Germans are alone.

COL. LANDA
Have a seat, Fraulein.
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
She lowers herself in the chair.
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
opposite her, the S.S. Colonel pulls another little chair over and
places it in front of the fraulein.
He sits, their knees almost touching.
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)
Let me see your foot.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
I beg your pardon?
Patting his lap.

COL. LANDA
Put your foot in my lap.

BRIDGET
Colonel, you embarrass me.

COL. LANDA
I assure you, Fraulein, my intention
is not to flirt.
Patting his lap more with more aggression.
The nervous fraulein lifts up her strappy dress shoe enclosed foot
and places it in the colonel's lap.
The Colonel very delicately unfastens the thin straps that
hold the fraulein's shoe on her foot . . .
. . . . He removes the shoe . . .
. . . . Leaving only the fraulein's bare foot . . .

THEN . . .
He removes from his heavy S.S. coat pocket the pretty dress shoe
the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane . . .
He slips it on her foot . . .
. . . . It fits like a glove.
Bridget knows she's BUSTED.
Col. Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
What's that American expression . . .
"If the shoe fits . . . you must wear it."
He removes her foot from his lap.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
What now, Colonel?

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)
Do you admit your treachery?
She stares defiant daggers into him.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
The only think I will admit to is resisting you

(ENGLISH)
Sons-a-bitches . . .

(GERMAN)
. . . to my last breath.

COL. LANDA
"Resist to your last breath"?

SUDDENLY . . .
Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
von Hammersmark's lily-white, delicate neck, and with all the
violence of a lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
Bridget's face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
BULGE and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her throat.
Now fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE VERY LIFE OUT
OF HER. Everything he has, he brings to bear on
the elegant lady's neck.
Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF

HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR . . .

BANG!

BANG!

BANG!
She's dead.
He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are

TREMBLING . . .
He rises.
Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bare hands
is the most violent act a human being can commit.
Also, only humans strangle, opposable thumbs being a quite
important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task
still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the trembling
that is rippling through his body. He takes out a silver S.S. FLASK
(filled with peach schnapps) and knocks back
a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.
Into the phone, in German, he says:

COL. LANDA
Inform the Fuhrer the audience has
taken their seats, and we're ready
to begin.
Step one in Hans's master plan, done.
He then dials another number . . .

INT—LOBBY—NIGHT
Aldo in the lobby . . .

WHEN . . .
. . . . He's JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS . . .
He's THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern-
day Secret Service, within seconds his wrists are handcuffed behind
his back and he's searched. They find the BOMB attached to his
ankle. It's removed, and a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his head.
Then he's hoisted up and RUSHED out of the building.
This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too. No one in the
auditorium is none the wiser . . .

INT—AUDITORIUM—NIGHT
. . . including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting among the
master race, waiting for showtime.

EXT—CINEMA—NIGHT
The six Nazi soldiers hustle the hooded Aldo down the red
carpet, then into the alley beside the cinema.
Aldo's put up against a wall.
Inside the black hood, he's SCREAMING every insulting thing
about Germany, Germans, German food, German
shepherd . . . anything.

COL. LANDA'S VOICE (OS)
Shut up!
The faceless black hood does.
Col. Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner,
says in ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
As Stanley said to Livingstone: Lieutenant Aldo
Raine, I presume?

LT. ALDO
Hans Landa?

COL. LANDA
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, you're now in the hands of the S.S. My
hands to be exact. And they've been waiting a
long time to touch you.
He reaches out with his finger and lightly touches Aldo's
face right in the middle of the hood.
Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.

COL. LANDA
Caught ya flinching.
In German, he orders the men to put Aldo in the back of a truck.
Aldo, bound and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeur's uniform,
bound and bagged like the lieutenant.
The truck drives off.
Col. Landa turns around and SEES FROM A DISTANCE Hitler's motorcade
pull up to the cinema. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels, Francesca, and
the rest of the entourage make their way down
the red carpet into the cinema.
Landa smiles.

EXT TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of
night.
We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.

INT—TRUCK (MOVING)—NIGHT
The two hooded prisoners bounce along in the back of the
truck.
Utivich is crying inside his hood.

LT. ALDO
Utivich?

UTIVICH
Is that you, Lieutenant?

LT. ALDO
Yep.

UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?

UTIVICH
Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirschberg?
The woman?

LT. ALDO
No, I do not.

UTIVICH
Lieutenant, sorry I'm crying.

LT. ALDO
Nothin' to be sorry about, son.
This bag get to anyone.

UTIVICH
Not exactly John Wayne, am I?

LT. ALDO
John Wayne's a pampered movie star.
He bursts into tears if his cook
busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
try puttin' a bag over his head and
hear what kinda sounds he makes.
Utivich giggles through the tears.

LT. ALDO
I just want you to know, son, I was
real proud of you tonight. Learnin'
how to drive overnight. Driving in
that limo line. You was in the hot
seat, son, and you stood up real good.
Utivich cries LOUDER.
Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivich's foot, and places his foot
on top.
The TOUCH has a slightly calming effect on Utivich.
In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

EXT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris (not La
Louisaiane).
The two hooded prisoners are walked inside the establishment.

INT—COUNTRY TAVERN—NIGHT
The hooded men are led into the closed for business, but open
for something else rustic tavern.
The Nazi guards unlock the handcuffs, then sit them down in chairs.
Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
The two prisoners are seated at a table, in what they can now
see is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
of the table sits Col. Hans Landa.
A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at an impressive-looking two-way
radio set up in the tavern.
Col. Landa starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated
American soldiers.
They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.

COL. LANDA
Italian? Really?

(BEAT)
What could you have possibly been thinking?

LT. ALDO
Well, I speak a little Italian—

COL. LANDA
I speak a little Tagalog, but I
wouldn't begin to presume I could
pass for Filipino. Don't get me
wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what
with you losing your Germans. And I have
nothing but admiration for improvisation.
Still . . . Chico Marx is more
convincing. If the three of you had
shown up at the premiere dressed
in woman's attire, it would have been
more convincing.
Landa's eyes go to the two Nazi guards behind the prisoners.

COL. LANDA

(GERMAN)
You may leave us. But stay alert outside.
They exit, leaving the colonel, the lieutenant, the
private, and a German radio man in the corner.

COL. LANDA
So you're Aldo the Apache?

LT. ALDO
So you're the Jew Hunter?

COL. LANDA
Jew Hunter (pfuit). I'm a detective.
A damn good detective. Finding
people is my specialty. So naturally
I worked for the Nazis finding people.
And yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.

UTIVICH
Well, you do hafta admit, it is
catchy.

COL. LANDA
Do you control the nicknames your enemies
bestow on you? Aldo the
Apache and the Little Man?

UTIVICH
What do you mean, the Little Man?

COL. LANDA
The German's nickname for you.

UTIVICH
The German's nickname for me is the Little Man?

COL. LANDA
Or the "Little One", either one means you.
And as if to make my point, I'm a
little surprised how tall you
are in real life. I mean, you're a
little fellow. But not circus-midget
little, as your reputation would
suggest.

LT. ALDO
Where are my men? Where is Bridget
von Hammersmark?

COL. LANDA
Bridget von Hammersmark. Oh, I'm sure she's in
whatever, big bubbling
cesspool in hell the devil reserves
for traitors of her ilk.

COL. LANDA

(CON'T)
Well, let's just say she got what
she deserved. And when you purchase
friends like Bridget von Hammersmark,
you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your paisanos
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Hirschberg—

LT. ALDO
How do you know our names?

COL. LANDA
Lt. Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't
interrogate every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors . . . ?
We simply aren't operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.
Now, back to the whereabouts of your
two Italian saboteurs. At this
moment, both Hirschberg
and Donowitz should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in. Seats
0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
Explosives, still around their ankles,
still ready to explode.
And your mission, some
would call it a terrorist plot, as of
this moment is still a go.
The two basterds don't believe this. It can't be true.

LT. ALDO
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next, Eliza on the ice?

COL. LANDA
However, all I have to do is
pick up that phone right there,
inform the cinema, and your plans
kaput.

LT. ALDO
IF they're still there, and IF they're still
alive, and that's one big IF, there ain't no
way you gonna take
them boys without settin' off them bombs.

COL. LANDA
I have no doubt, and yes, some
Germans will die, and yes, it will
ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
will be very very very mad at you
for what you've done to his big night. But you
won't get Hitler, you won't
get Goebbels, you won't get Goering,
and you won't get Boormann. And you
need all four to end the war.
(pause)
But if I don't pick up that phone
right there, you may very well get
all four. And if you get all four,
you end the war . . . tonight.
The Nazi colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti and fills
three glasses. As he pours, he says:

COL. LANDA
So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of
ending the war . . . tonight.
All three have their Chianti filled glasses.

COL. LANDA
So the way I see it, since Hitler's death, or
possible rescue, rests
solely on my reaction . . . If I do nothing . .
. It's as if I'm causing his death, even more
than yourselves.
Would you agree?

LT. ALDO
I guess so.

COL. LANDA
How about you, Utivich?

UTIVICH
I guess so too.

COL. LANDA
Good, we more or less all agree. Gentlemen, I
have no intention of killing Hitler, and
killing Goebbels, and killing Goering, and
killing Boormann, not to mention winning the
war single-handedly for the Allies,
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.
Now they get it.

COL. LANDA
If you want to win the war, tonight,
we have to make a deal.

LT. ALDO
What kinda deal?

COL. LANDA
The kind you wouldn't have the
authority to make. However, I'm sure this
mission of yours has a
commanding officer? A general, I'm betting. For
(thinking)
. . . . O.S.S. would be my guess.
Aldo's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.

COL. LANDA
Oooh, that's a bingo. Is that the
way you say it, that's a bingo?

LT. ALDO
You just say, bingo.

COL. LANDA
Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
were we? Oh, yes, make a deal. Over there is a
very capable two-way
radio. And sitting behind it is a
more than capable radio operator
named Herrman. Get me somebody on
the other end of that radio with the power of
the pen to authorize my—
let's call it, the terms of my conditional
surrender, if that tastes better going down.

BACK TO THE PREMIER
Shosanna is in the booth. She brings down the lights.
In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down.
CU CURTAIN SWITCH. She flips it.
In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part.
Shosanna throws the lever on the first projector.
The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM . . .
FILM REELS rotate . . .
35mm FILM moves through the projector's film gate . . .
The opening seal of a film by the THIRD REICH flickers on the

SCREEN . . .
Goebbels and Francesca watch . . .
Hitler watches . . .
Fredrick watches . . .
Donowitz and Hirschberg watch . . .
Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window . . .
The CAMERA PANS OFF of Shosanna to the clearly marked film
can, REEL 4. The SURPRISE REEL.

BACK TO LANDA AND THE BASTERDS
Landa, with radio headphones over his ears and a microphone
in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American brass on the
other end.

COL. LANDA
. . . So, when the military history of this
night is written, it will be recorded that I
was part of
Operation Kino from the very
beginning, as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as an S.S.
colonel was sanctioned by the O.S.S., as a
necessary evil to
establish my cover with the Germans.
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and
Goebbels's opera box that assured their demise.
By the way, that last
part is actually true.

FLASH ON
Landa placing bomb in Hitler and Goebbels's opera box.

BACK TO LANDA

COL. LANDA
I want my full military pension and benefits
under my proper rank.
I want to receive the Congressional
Medal of Honor for my invaluable
assistance in the toppling of the Third
Reich.
He looks over and sees Aldo and Utivich watching the one-sided
conversation.

COL. LANDA
In fact, I want all the members of "Operation
Kino" to receive the Congressional Medal of
Honor. Full citizenship for myself—but that
goes without saying. And I would
like the United States of America to purchase
property for me on
Nantucket island, as a reward for
all the countless lives I've saved
by bringing the tyranny of the
National Socialist Party to a
swifter than imagined end. Do you
have all that, sir?
(pause)
I look forward to seeing you face to face as
well, sir.
(pause)
He's right here.
The colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.

LT. ALDO
Yes, sir?
We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio give Aldo his
orders:

RADIO VOICE (OS)
Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Utivich in a truck as
prisoners. Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck,
drive to our lines. Upon crossing
our lines, Colonel Landa and his
man will surrender to you. You will
then take over driving of the truck and bring
them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

LT. ALDO
Yes, sir.
The conversation is over. He puts the radio down.
The three men look at one another.
Landa picks up his wine.

COL. LANDA
So I suppose the only thing left to
do is lift a glass and toast to
Donowitz and Hirschberg's success.
You too, Herrman, come over here.
The four men, Col. Hans Landa, Lt. Aldo Raine, Pfc. Smithson
Utivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.

COL. LANDA
Gentlemen, to history, and its witnesses.

CHEERS.

BACK TO THE PREMIERE

WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.
Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in an ornamental tower in
a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIERS below.

A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY
peering at the German private through binoculars. He lowers
the long-range glasses and confers with one of his OFFICERS.

GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)
What's the death toll?

OFFICER

(RUSSIAN)
47, so far.

WE HEAR A SHOT.

OFFICER

(RUSSIAN)
48. General, I implore you, we must destroy
that tower!

GEN. KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)
That tower is one of the oldest and
most beautiful structures in Russia.
I won't be responsible for turning a thousand
years of history into dust!
A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER tries to run between two buildings.
Zoller gets him.
Then proceeds to pick him apart, one bullet at a time.

SHOSANNA IN THE PROJECTION BOOTH
She removes "REEL 4" (the Special Shosanna Reel) and prepares
it on the second projector. Reel 3, on the first projector, playing
now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it's going to be
show time.
Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

MARCEL
It's time. I should go lock the auditorium and
take my place behind the screen.
This is the last time they will ever see each other—too much
to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I
die wet one on her.

DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS-UNIFORM
NAZIS. They've developed a dopey way of communicating with each
other in this hostile environment.
Basically, speaking English as if it were gibberish Italian
they say English words, only adding an "I" or "A" or "O"
to the end of it. And saying it in an exaggerated Italian
accent, complete with pantomimes.
Donowitz leans into Hirschberg and says in a whisper:
They speak in ITALIAN-ISH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

SGT. DONOWITZ

(ITALIAN-ISH)
I-a go-a toilet-a, set-ta Boom-a.
(I go to the toilet and set the bomb.)
When-a I-a go-a, you-a set-ta Boom-a.
(When I go, you set your bomb.)
Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes that he can't set his bomb
surrounded by all these Nazis.
Donowitz pantomimes crossing his legs and setting the bomb on his
ankle in his seat. Then getting up and dropping it in the back of
the auditorium in the dark.
Hirschberg doesn't get it.

HIRSCHBER
What-a?
(What?)
Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less
patience.

HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato
(Affirmative, affirmative.)

SGT. DONOWITZ
They-o look-o screen-a, not-o you-a.
(They're looking at the screen, not you.)

HIRSCHBERG
Fantastic-o.
(Fantastic.)

SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, set-ta, five-o moment-o
(pointing to
watch)
You-a, pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes, and
get out of here.)

HIRSCHBERG
What-o?
(What?)

SGT. DONOWITZ
Confussi-i, confuss-i, confuss-i.
(Confused, confused, confused.)
What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?
(I thought "What-a" meant "What."
Does "What-o" mean "What," as well?)

HIRSCHBERG
Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o meant-a "What-a."
(Oh, sorry, I meant what.)

SGT. DONOWITZ
After-teri, you-a set-ta bom-a,
five-o moment-o, you-a, fuck-o pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five minutes and
get the fuck out of here.)

HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.
(Affirmative, affirmative.)

SGT. DONOWITZ
Good-a, luck-a.
(Good luck.)
Donowitz stands up from his seat and walks out of the dark
auditorium into the lobby. The Nazi guards/ushers are gone, and
the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant the
Boom-a—I mean, the bomb.

DESCENDING THE STAIRS
leading to the water closet. Like a lot of old cinemas, not
only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
it. In the smoking lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
guards/ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers'
gossip. They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool and walks right through
them.
They look up but don't disturb their time-off vibe.
Donny enters the big water closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
Donny has the whole washroom to himself.
He enters the privacy of a toilet stall and locks the door.

MARCEL IN LOBBY
He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth into
the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors
and peers inside.

WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCEL'S POV
in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
Fredrick's exploits onscreen.
Marcel closes the door and, with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.

INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on either
side of the screen . . . Due to curtains placed there, no one
notices Marcel's actions.
Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN. WE SEE THE IMAGE
(backward) of Fredrick's sniper battle HUGE, COVERING THE ENTIRE
SIDE OF THE ROOM . . . A PILE of over 300 nitrate FILM PRINTS lies
like a junk pile, right behind the screen.
Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen and
pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, an absolute no-no in a
cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?
He smokes and waits for his cue to . . . BURN IT DOWN!

FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
alongside Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and Boormann. Onscreen
the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in Goebbel's
ear we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face (at least
sympathetic for Goebbels) and says in German:

GOEBBELS
Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after
the show.
He exits the opera box and walks to the projection booth
door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
The door opens, just a little bit. Shosanna, not friendly,
stares at him.
He, as usual, is all smiles and charm.
They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH:

FREDRICK
Are you the manager of this cinema?
I want my money back. That actor in
the movie stinks.
He laughs.
She doesn't even smile. She says, all serious business:

SHOSANNA
What are you doing here?

FREDRICK
I came to visit you.

SHOSANNA
Can't you see how busy I am?

FREDRICK
Then allow me to lend an assist.

SHOSANNA
Fredrick, it's not funny. You can't
be here. This is your premiere. You
need to be out there with them.
As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale with all the
charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
is just about over and her big reel change is coming up.

FREDRICK
Normally, you would be right.
And for all the other films I do,
I intend to endure evenings like
tonight in the proper spirit.
However, the fact remains, this film
is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits
consisted of me killing many men. Consequently,
the part of the film
that's playing now, . . . I don't like watching
this part.

SHOSANNA
Fredrick, I am sorry, but—

FREDRICK
—So, I thought I'd come up here
and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it
would appear I haven't lost my touch.

DONNY IN TOILET
Sgt. Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer for six minutes
from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the toilet tank.

CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
We see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
Donny's feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR the OFFSCREEN Nazi
enlisted man finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
THROUGH FRAME . . . WE FOLLOW THEM TO . . . the SINK . . . WE STAY
ON the shoes . . . as WE HEAR the Soldier WASH HIS HANDS . . . THEN
. . . THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG . . . till . . . WE'RE EYE
LEVEL with the German soldier, with an ARMY CAP on his head, who's
done washing his hands . . . THEN . . . the soldier removes
his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE SEE

THE SWASTIKA HAND-CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, THE UNDENIABLE MARK OF
THE BASTERDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking lounge.
As he exits THE FRAME, he says to somebody OFFSCREEN;

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

(GERMAN)
Hey, Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes. Now
pay up.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna still baring
the way.

SHOSANNA
I have to get prepared for the reel change.

FREDRICK
Let me do it?

SHOSANNA
No.

FREDRICK
Oh, please, it's been two years since I've done
a reel change.

SHOSANNA
I said, no.

FREDRICK
(cute whine)
Come on, it's my premiere.

SHOSANNA
Are you so used to the Nazis kissing your ass,
you've forgotten what the
word "no" means? No, Fredrick, you
can't come in here. Now go away!
No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time. He gets it.
He does a one-armed PILE-DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
it OPEN and Shosanna back into the room.
Fredrick, a different cat than we've seen up till now, enters
the booth, closing the door behind him and LOCKING it.
The quite startled Shosanna says to Fredrick:

SHOSANNA
Fredrick, you hurt me.

FREDRICK
Well, it's nice to know you can feel something.
Even if it's just physical pain.
Fredrick steps forward . . .
Shosanna steps backward . . .

FREDRICK
I'm not a man you say "Go away"
to. There's over three hundred
dead bodies in Russia that, if
they could, would testify to that.
After what I've done for you, you disrespect me
at your peril.

BACK TO WASHROOM
The Swastika forehead soldier gets a light for his cigarette.
He takes a big drag.

SOLDIER'S POV
He faces the washroom, and down that long row, he sees Donny emerge
from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off and
draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt
and black tuxedo vest, he's quite far away, so now he just
looks like some guy in a tux who just finished taking a shit. Donny
walks toward us . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him get closer . . .

SOLDIER POV
Donny gets closer . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him closer still . . .

SOLDIER POV
Donny gets closer . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
begins to notice . . .

SOLDIER POV
Donny getting closer, begins to notice the German soldier notice
him . . .

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
Now Donny is close enough for the soldier to recognize. His
face SCREAMS:

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
The Bear Jew!!!
The soldier's GUN is out of its holster and rising toward
Donny's chest . . .

WHEN . . .
Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and FIRES
a GUN concealed under it.
HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest . . . who finishes raising
his GUN, FIRING, HITTING Donny in the chest . . .
The two soldiers FIRE INTO each other . . . till their weapons are
empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
The ten other NAZIS in the room stand shocked at what just happened
in front of them.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN THE PROJECTION ROOM
Fredrick hears the gunshots below them and turns toward the
door.

FREDRICK
What the hell was that?
While Fredrick's back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of
her pocket and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back . . .
. . . He CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLS FACE FIRST to
the floor . . .
Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out the projection booth window into
the audience . . .
The ONSCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE that her
weapon didn't stand a chance of being heard.
Her eyes go from the audience . . .
. . . up to the big screen . . .
. . . which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight, handsome CLOSEUP.
The face on the silver screen breaks the young girl's
heart . . .
. . . She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood
flowing from the holes she put in his back . . .
. . . His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN . . .
. . . DYING though he is, at this moment Fredrick is still

ALIVE . . .
Shosanna moves to him . . .
. . . She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN . . .
. . . She turns his body over on its back . . .
. . . He's holding a LUGER in his hand . . .
. . . He FIRES TWICE . . .

BANG BANG
Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST . . .
THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her
knees to the floor . . .
. . . Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor . . .

. . . FIRES . . .
HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh . . .
. . . SPINNING her BODY around in agony . . .
Like he did to the Russian onscreen, he picks her apart, one bullet
at a time . . .

. . . FIRES . . .

A BULLET BLOWS OFF THE HEEL OF HER FOOT . . .
The Luger drops to floor. Fredrick DIES.
Our young French Jewish heroine lies on the projection booth
floor in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with
bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and

DYING . . .

WHEN . . .
. . . The little bell on the 1st projector starts to ring,
informing the projectionist it's time for the REEL CHANGE.
Dying or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she's going
to have to lift her ass off the floor and execute this fucking reel
change.

CINEMA AUDITORIUM
The battle onscreen continues. The audience is riveted.
The FUHRER
watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
He says to Goebbels in German:

HITLER
Extraordinary, Joseph, simply extraordinary.
This is your finest
film yet.
Goebbels is beyond proud. He smiles to Francesca, who proudly pats
his hand.

Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE stares
down the auditorium of Nazis brings to mind Orwells "1984"
Big Brother.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
React.

HIRSCHBERG
standing in the middle of the aisle, turns toward the screen. When
he sees Shosanna's GIANT FACE, he's gobsmacked.

SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE ONSCREEN
She stares down the packed house of Nazis and says
in FRENCH:

SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE
I have a message for Germany. I'm interrupting
your Nazi propaganda horseshit to inform you
dispicable German swine that you're all going
to die.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
react.

HIRSCHBERG
reacts.

MARCEL
smiles.

SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE
And I want you to look deep in the face of the
Jew who's going to do it.

The crowd reacts . . .
The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles to topple
from its jury-rigged placement and CRASH onto the
audience below . . .
ONSCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.

SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the
face of Jewish vengeance! Marcel, BURN IT DOWN!

BEHIND THE SCREEN
Marcel takes his cigarette and FLICKS IT into the pile of
nitrate film.
ONSCREEN SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the scrambling
little Nazis, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE

OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE BURST THROUGH SHOSANNA'S FACE
and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.
The AUDIENCE
STAMPEDES toward the exits . . .

HIRSCHBERG
with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive "Day of the Locust"

SWARM OF BODIES . . .
People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to
their grizzly fate.
The FLAMES and FIRE spread through the auditorium . . .
Hirschberg, caught in the people crunch, knows this is it.

HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
right underneath everybody in the room.
The effect this has on the people in the room is very similar
to that of the effect an M-80 blowing up in an ant hill would have
on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs, arms,
heads, torsos, and asses.

THEN . . . ,

DONOWITZ'S TOILET BOMB
BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.

COLLAPSING THE CINEMA AND BLOWING OUT THE FRONT OF THE

EXT—WOODS—MORNING
It's a misty early morning in a woodsy area. The German
truck, with Aldo and Utivich in the back, and Landa and
Herrman in the front, comes to a stop.
LANDA and HERRMAN IN THE TRUCK CAB
Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German:

HERRMAN
These are the American lines, sir.
In the back of the truck sit the two last remaining members
of the Basterds, Lt. Aldo Raine and Pfc. Smithson Utivich,
both with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
Landa and Herrman appear at the truck rear. Landa says in ENGLISH:

COL. LANDA
Okay, gentlemen, you can climb down.
Aldo and Utivich climb down from the truck.
Col. Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
the two prisoners.
He does.

COL. LANDA
Herrman, hand them your weapon.
He does.
Col. Landa hands over his LUGER and his very-cool-looking S.S.

DAGGER.

COL. LANDA
I am officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lieutenant Raine. We are your
prisoners.

LT. ALDO
Thank you very much, Colonel. Utivich, cuff the
colonel's hands behind his back.

COL. LANDA
Is that really necessary?
As Utivich cuffs the Colonel's hands behind his back, Aldo
says:

LT. ALDO
I'm a slave to appearances.
Then Aldo takes the Luger and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
The bound Col. Landa is appalled.

COL. LANDA
Are you mad? What have you done? I made a deal
with your general for that man's life!

LT. ALDO
Yeah, they made that deal, but they don't give
a fuck about him, they
need you.

COL. LANDA
You'll be shot for this.

LT. ALDO
Naw, I don't think so, more like I'll
be chewed out. I've been chewed out before. You
know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you
made with the brass. End the war tonight? I'd
make that deal. How 'bout you, Utivich, you
make that deal?

UTIVICH
I'd make that deal.

LT. ALDO
I don't blame ya. Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest ya
feathered for yourself. Well, if
you're willing to barbecue the whole high
command, I suppose that's worth certain
considerations. Now I don't
care about you gettin' pensions,
merit badges, ticker-tape parades,
who gives a damn, let's all go home.
But I do have one question.
When you go to your little place on
Nantucket island, I imagine you gonna
take off that handsome-looking S.S.
uniform of yours, ain't ya?
For the first time in the movie, Col. Landa doesn't respond.

LT. ALDO
That's what I thought. Now that . . .
. . . I can't abide. How bout you,
Utivich, can you abide it?

UTIVICH
Not one damn bit, sir.

LT. ALDO
I mean if I had my way, you'd wear
that goddamn uniform for the rest of
our pecker-suckin' life. But I'm
aware that ain't practical. I mean
at some point ya gotta hafta take it off.
He opens Landa's S.S. DAGGER and holds the blade in front of Hans's
face.

LT. ALDO
So I'm gonna give you a little
somethin you can't take off.

CU COL. LANDA
The dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his
forehead.

COL. LANDA'S POV
On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who
straddles him. And Utivich, who's next to him. The two
Basterds admire Aldo's handiwork.
Aldo turns to Uitivich and says:

LT. ALDO
You know somethin', Utivich? I think this just
might be my masterpiece.
They ghoulishly giggle.

EXT. FIRING RANGE - DAY

VIDEO
A chorus line of six beautiful bikini-clad women, all
holding different automatic weapons, BLASTING away.
The cheap VIDEO TITLES to:

"CHICKS WHO LOVE GUNS"
Play over this image.
One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous
brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera
holding a TEC-9 and describing it.

SIDNEY
(to camera)
Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
its makers as being tough as the
toughest customer.
SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of
birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney
continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S
VOICE begins talking over the video.

BLACK MAN (O.S.)
That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass
spray gun outta South Miami.
After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.

BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Cost three-eighty retail. I get them
for two hundred and sell 'em for
eight.

INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT
The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL

ROBBIE.
Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At
this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
(the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
body language and his thought process.
While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
correction facility, in the real world his timing is
thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
but attempt to sing anyway.
The third person watching the video is the person who
lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
paying no attention to the video.

ORDELL
This TEC-9? They advertise it as
being the most popular gun in
American crime. Can you believe that
shit? It actually says that on the
little booklet that comes with it.
"Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"
like they're proud of that shit.
Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.
Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
bikini, holding a Styer Aug.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Check out this body-builder chick...
Now see what she got. That's a Styer
aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
Listen.
Ordell punches up the volume.
Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.
Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
Austria. My customers don't know shit
about it, so there ain't no demand.
(to Melanie)
Baby, I could use some more ice.
Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
from him and moves to the kitchen.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
But put that bad boy in a flick,
every motherfucker out there want
one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
they don't want one, they want two,
cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
What they don't know, and that movie
don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try
and steer a customer towards a 9-
millimeter. Damn near the same
weapon, don't have half the jammin'
problems. But some niggas out there,
you can't tell them anything. They
want a .45. The killer had a .45,
they want a .45.
Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then
sits where she was.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Thanks, Baby.

LOUIS
Who's your partner?
Ordell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading
"Movieline Inside" magazine.

ORDELL
Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in
Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to
him, gets it to my customers. On all
my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't
have a pot to piss in or a window to
throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now,
motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He
got himself a yacht, with all kinds
of high tech navigational shit on it.
(back to video)
AK-47, the very best there is.
GLORIA, a tall, Amazonian, bikini-clad, black woman faces
camera and describes the AK-47.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
When you absolutely, positively,
gotta kill every motherfucker in the
room, accept no substitute. That
there is the Chinese one. I pay eight-
fifty and double my money.
The phone rings.

ORDELL(CONT'D)
Get that for me, will ya baby?

MELANIE
You know it's for you.
Ordell just stares at her.

ORDELL
Girl, you better not make me go over
there and put my feet to ya.
Louis keeps staring at he screen.
Melanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates
the living room from the kitchen, picks up the phone,
says:

MELANIE
Hello.
Puts the phone down and says;

MELANIE (CONT'D)
It's for you.
Before Ordell knows it, Melanie is back in the reclining
chair, reclining back all the way.
Ordell, pissed, looks at her a moment before taking the
phone.

ORDELL
(into phone)
Yeah.
(pause)
Hey, Junebug, what's up
Louis sits on he couch, drinking his Jack Daniels,
watching the video.
Melanie lies back on the reclining chair, takes a hit off
her pipe, then says in a 'holding in smoke' voice;

MELANIE
(referring to the tape)
It's boring, isn't it?

LOUIS
I can sit through it once.

MELANIE
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

LOUIS
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.

MELANIE
He's just repeating shit he
overheard. He ain't any more a gun
expert than I am.
Holding up her pipe.

MELANIE
Want a hit?

LOUIS
Sure.
Louis takes a hit off the pipe.

MELANIE
When did you get out of jail?

LOUIS
Four days ago.

MELANIE
Where at?

LOUIS
Susanville.

MELANIE
How long?

LOUIS
Two months shy of four years.

MELANIE
Four years?

LOUIS
Uh-huh.

MELANIE
What for?

LOUIS
Bank robbery.

MELANIE
Really, I'm impressed.
Louis takes a drink of whiskey.

MELANIE
Four years that's a long fuckin time.
Louis nods his head in agreement.
Ordell hangs up the phone.
Ordell comes back, sitting down on the other side of
Louis.

ORDELL
See, what did I tell you? Man in New
York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and
Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want
it? It's the gun that nigga on "New
York Undercover" uses. Because of
that nigga, I can sell it to this
nigga for twelve-fifty.

LOUIS
What's your cost?

ORDELL
As low as two.

LOUIS
Are you serious?

ORDELL
That's what I been tellin' you. Start
adding these motherfuckin' figures
up, and you tell me this ain't a
business to be in.
The phone rings again.
Ordell looks at Melanie.
Melanie looks at Ordell.
They have a bit of a staring contest before she gets up
and gets the phone.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I got me five M-60 machine guns.
These came straight from the Gulf
War. I sold me three of them so far,
twenty grand a piece.

LOUIS
That's good money.

ORDELL
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna
make me a million dollars out of
this. I already got me a half-a-
million sittin' in Mexico. When I do
this last delivery, I'm gonna make me
another half-million.

LOUIS
Then what?

ORDELL
I get out. Spend the rest of my life
spending.
Melanie sits back down in he chair.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Who is it?

MELANIE
It's Beaumont.

KITCHEN
Ordell, drink in hand, picks up the receiver.

ORDELL
(into phone)
Beaumont Ordell. What's the problem?
(pause)
What the fuck you doin' in jail?
(pause)
What the fuck you doin' that for?
(pause)
Ain't you got better sense than to be
drivin' drunk carrying a goddam
pistol?
He listens to Beaumont on the other line - it's obvious
Beaumont's starting to freak out. Ordell changes his
tone.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
- Beaumont. Beaumont. Listen to me.
Number one, you need to chill out,
nigga. Bad as this shit is, this shit
ain't as bad as you think it is.
(pause)
Course you're scared. That's what
these motherfuckers get paid for
scarin' the shit outta ya. That's
their job. And my job is to get you
the fuck home so let me tell you what
is gonna happen... May I speak?...
Thank you... You gonna spend the
night in jail; it's too late to get
you out now. Tomorrow, they gonna
take you into court. I'm gonna be
there. Judge gonna set your bail. I'm
gonna pay your bail, they gonna cut
you loose. By tomorrow night, you'll
be back home, I promise.
(pause)
So just calm your ass down, and I'll
see you tomorrow.
(pause)
You owe me a helluva lot more than
one, nigga.
(laughs)
See you.
Ordell hangs up the phone.

EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
The store front window of Cherry Bail Bonds in Inglewood,
California. The name of the business is spelled out on
the window, which also includes a drawing of a fat red
cherry.
Ordell's BLACK MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE pulls up.
Ordell in the driver's seat. Louis in shotgun position.

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
Inside Cherry Bail Bonds, looking out through the picture
window. We can read the name on the glass backwards.
Ordell and Louis appears in the window and enter the
building. Ordell carries a L.A. Lakers athletic bag.
An unidentified MALE VOICE, obviously on the telephone,
can be heard.
Ordell goes toward the voice and tells Louis to "hang
back."

MALE VOICE (O.S.)
... the judge doesn't give a fuck
about that. He's ready to habitualize
you. Is that what you want - you
wanna look at ten years?
The voice belong to MAX CHERRY, bail bondsman. Max, a
regular-Joe-type white guy in his fifties, sits behind
his desk talking on the phone. His eyes raise as he sees
Ordell approach him.

MAX (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Just overnight is all. Tomorrow I'll
get you out, I promise. But it means
I gotta pick you up tonight.
Ordell motion to the chair in front of Max's desk. Max
motions for Ordell to take a seat.

MAX (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Reggie, there ain't no two ways about
it. You're spending the night in
jail, but I already told you I'll get
you out tomorrow. Now where are you?
(pause)
You're at your mother's house, aren't
you?
Ordell lights up a cigarette. (Viceroy).
He notices a picture on the wall of Max with his arm
around a big, powerfully built black man. They're both
grinning.
Louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a
small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered
non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a
rock. Louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage.

MAX (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Okay. Just stay put till I come for
you.
(pause)
Reggie, do yourself a really big
favor and be there when I get there.
He hangs up the phone.
Ordell sits in front of the desk, smiling at him and
smoking.

MAX (CONT'D)
How can I help you?

ORDELL
(indicating the Viceroy)
Where would you like me to put my
ash?
Max looks at him for a moment.

MAX
Use that coffee cup on the desk.
Ordell picks up the coffee cup, which still has a little
bit of coffee in it, and flicks his ash.

ORDELL
And I need me a bond for ten
thousand.
Max throws a look past Ordell to Louis.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Oh, that's just my white friend,
Louis. He's got nothing to do with my
business. We just hangin together.
We're on our way to a cocktail
lounge.
From across the room, Louis nods his head in Max's
direction.
Max looks at him a moment, then back to Ordell.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
(returning to the photo)
Who's that big Mandingo nigga you
gotcha arm around?
Max looks at him a moment and says;

MAX
That's Winston. He works here.

ORDELL
He's a big one. You two tight?

MAX
Yeah.

ORDELL
It was our idea to take the picture,
wasn't it?
Max looks at Ordell, getting his drift, then says;

MAX
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar
bond. What've you got for collateral?

ORDELL
Gonna have to put up cash.

MAX
You have it with you?
Ordell picks up his Lakers bag and puts it in the empty
chair next to him.

ORDELL
It's in my bag.

MAX
You have cash. What do you need me
for?

ORDELL
C'mon, you know how they do. Black
man comes in with ten thousand, they
wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they
gonna wanna know where I got it.
Second, they gonna keep a big chunk
of it - start talkin' that court cost
shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go
through you.

MAX
Cost you a thousand for the bond.

ORDELL
I know that.
Louis just stands, feeling uncomfortable, in the other
room drinking coffee.

MAX
Who's it for? A relative?

ORDELL
Fella named Beaumont. They have him
up at county. It started out drunk
driving, but they wrote it up
"possession of a concealed weapon."
Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.

MAX
Ten thousand sounds high.

ORDELL
They ran his name and got a hit. He's
been in before. Besides, Beaumont's
from Kentucky, and I think they're
prejudiced against black men from the
South out here.

MAX
He takes off and I gotta go to
Kentucky to bring him back, you pay
the expenses.

ORDELL
You think you could do that?
Max taking papers out of the drawer...

MAX
I've done it.
... picking up the pen...

MAX (CONT'D)
What's his full name?

ORDELL
Beaumont. That's the only name I
know.
Max looks at Ordell, but doesn't ask him the obvious
question.
Max picks up the phone.

MAX
(on phone)
Records office.
Max on hold, looks at Ordell.
Ordell smiles.

MAX (CONT'D)
(back on the line)
Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry
Bail Bonds. Who's this?
(pause)
Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you to
look up the booking card and rough
arrest on a defendant named Beaumont.
(pause)
That's all I have. I believe it's a
surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.
Louis enters the area, standing over Ordell.

LOUIS
I'm going to wait in the car.

ORDELL
Sure.
(to Max)
We almost done, ain't we?

MAX
Getting there.

ORDELL
You go wait in the car. Wait a
minute.
Ordell pulls out a heavy-duty keychain with a shitload of
keys on it.

ORDELL
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.

LOUIS
Which one is for the car?
Ordell finds it. While he goes through the keys, Vicki
comes back on the line.
Max speaks with her as he fills out his papers.

ORDELL
(holding a key)
This one's for the ignition...
(holding a little black
box)
... but you gotta hit this thing to
shut the alarm off and unlock the
door.

LOUIS
What do I do?

ORDELL
You ain't got to do nothing. Just
point at it and push the button.
You'll hear the car go "bleep." That
means the alarm's off and the doors
are open.

LOUIS
Okay.

ORDELL
Now play the volume as loud as you
want but don't touch my levels. I got
them set just the way I want 'em.
Louis nods and goes out.

EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
Louis walks out of the office. He goes up to Ordell's
black Mercedes. He points the little black box at it. The
car goes BLEEP.
He gingerly approaches it, opens the door and climbs
inside.

INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY
Max hangs up the phone.

MAX
(to Ordell)
Beaumont Livingston.

ORDELL
Livingston, huh?

MAX
On his prior, he served nine months,
and he's working on four years'
probation.

ORDELL
You don't say.

MAX
Do you know what he's on probation
for?

ORDELL
Haven't a clue.

MAX
Possession of unregistered machine
guns.

ORDELL
Will they consider this a violation
of his probation?

MAX
They do consider this a violation of
his probation. Your boy's looking at
ten years, plus the concealed weapon.

ORDELL
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont
don't got a doin' time disposition.

MAX
I need your name and address.

ORDELL
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B-I-
E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton

90222.

MAX
House or apartment?

ORDELL
House.

MAX
Now I need you to count your money.
Ordell hands him the Lakers bag. Max takes the money out
putting it on the desk.

ORDELL
Hope you don't mind me askin' where
you keepin' my money till I get it
back. In your drawer?
Max begins counting it.

MAX
Across the street a Great Western. It
goes in a trust account. You'll need
to fill out an Application for
Appearance Bond, an Indemnity
Agreement, a Contingent Promissory
Note. That's the one, if Beaumont
skips and I go after him, you pay the
expenses.

ORDELL
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.
(he takes a pen out of
his pocket)
Where do I sign?
Max pulls the forms from his desk, and lays them in front
of Ordell. Max goes back to counting the money. Ordell
reads the first agreement then says;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
(reading the form)
Hey, Max.

MAX
(still counting money)
Yes.

ORDELL
(still reading form)
I was wondering. What if before the
court date gets here, Beaumont gets
hit by a bus or something and dies.
(he puts the form down
and looks at Max)
I get my money back, don't I?

CUT TO:

A BLACK FINGER
Pressing a BLACK BUTTON next to the name, "BEAUMONT

LIVINGSTON".

INT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
BEAUMONT LIVINGSTON, wearing no shirt, sweatpants, and
smoking a fatty answers the intercom, which buzzes
loudly. We can hear JAY LENO interviewing a CELEBRITY on

TV OFFSCREEN.

BEAUMONT
(into the speaker)
Who is it?

EXT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Ordell stands outside the security gate of Beaumont's
Hollywood apartment.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell's lips talking into the intercom
speaker.

ORDELL
It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me
up.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - Beaumont's finger pressing the entry
button.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - The doorknob on the security gate,
BUZZING. Ordell's hand comes into frame twisting it open.
Beaumont opens his apartment door, fatty between his
fingers. He sees Ordell approach.
Ordell greets him, arms spread out in hug mode, with a
big smile across his face.

ORDELL
Look at you and your free ass. Come
over and give me a motherfuckin' hug.
Ordell and Beaumont embrace.

BEAUMONT
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious,
man. What the fuck can I say? Thank
you... thank you... thank you.

ORDELL
Who was there for your ass?

BEAUMONT
You were there for me.

ORDELL
Who?

BEAUMONT
You.
Laughing his hustler's laugh and bumping Beaumont's fist
hard.

ORDELL
You goddam right!
Beaumont laughs.

ORDELL
You see, it works like this. You get
your ass in trouble, I get your ass
out. That's my job. And I don't mind
tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.

BEAUMONT
I'm still scared as a motherfucker,
Ordell. They talkin' like they
serious 'bout me doin' that machine
gun time.

ORDELL
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a
fright in your ass.

BEAUMONT
If that's what they want to do,
they're doin' it.

ORDELL
How old is that machine gun shit?

BEAUMONT
Three years.

ORDELL
Three years. That crime's old, man.
They ain't got room in prison for all
the motherfuckers out there killin'
people. How they gonna find room for
you?

BEAUMONT
That's not what they're tellin' me.

ORDELL
That's why they call it "fuckin' with
ya." Now you wanna hear how we
retaliate?
Beaumont takes a hit off the fatty and nods his head.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to
Century City, meet my lawyer. Now let
me tell you a little bit about my
lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins and
this nigga is a junkyard dog! He's my
own private Johnie Cochran. In fact,
he'd kick Johnie Cochran's ass. And
like Johnie Cochran, dude hates
fuckin' cops. I'm serious, this man
lives to fuck with the police. So as
a favor, I had him look at your case.
Stacin told me you aint got shit to
worry about. They just fuckin' wit
ya. So we sic the junkyard dog on
their ass, make 'em -
(he bumps fist with Beaumont)
... Stop fuckin' wit ya!
Beaumont gesture inside his apartment.

BEAUMONT
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you
know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.

ORDELL
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was
kinda hopin you could come with me.

BEAUMONT
What'd ya mean?

ORDELL
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga,
does a nigga a favor - then BAM -
hits a nigga up for a favor in
return. But I'm afraid I gotta be
that kinda nigga.

BEAUMONT
What?

ORDELL
I need a favor.

BEAUMONT
That requires me goin out tonight?

ORDELL
A bit.

BEAUMONT
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on
goin no place. It's twelve o'clock,
man. I'm home, I'm high -

ORDELL
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I
spent ten thousand dollars gittin'
your ass home.
(changes tone)
Look, I gotta problem. I need help,
and you can help me.
This has the desired effect.

TIME CUT:

WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
Beaumont comes out of the apartment, sporting Nikes and a
Queen Latifah t-shirt. He locks his front door and walks
with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We
STEDICAM in front of them the whole way.

BEAUMONT
What's the problem?

ORDELL
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
situation. Remember I sold those
three M-60 machine guns outta the
five I got?

BEAUMONT
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
This group of Koreans in Koreatown
have started a Neighborhood Watch
kinda thing. And they want a few
weapons so the neighborhood niggas
know they mean business. So I'm gonna
sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
Only problem, I aint never dealt with
these Koreans before. Now I aint
worried. Asians are by and large real
dependable. They don't want no
trouble. You might argue about price,
but you aint gotta worry about them
shootin' you in the back. But I got
me kind of a rule. Never do business
with nobody you ain't never done
business with before without backup.
That's why I need you, backup.

BEAUMONT
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out
nowhere -

ORDELL
- Let me finish. Can I finish?

BEAUMONT
Go ahead.

CUT TO:

TRUNK
The trunk of a car is opened.
Ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump
action shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part
of any Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as
a playing piece.

ORDELL
Now you're gonn be in the trunk
holding onto the shotgun. And I'm
going to tell them I'm opening up my
trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up
the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad
boy.

BEAUMONT
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin'
anybody.

ORDELL
What the fuck I tell you. You don't
hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the
gun. They'll get the idea.

BEAUMONT
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.

ORDELL
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll
be in there - ten minutes.

BEAUMONT
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk
no minutes. Why don't I just ride
with you?

ORDELL
You can't ride with me. The surprise
effect is ninety percent of it.

BEAUMONT
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gittin' in that trunk.

ORDELL
I can't believe you do me this way.

BEAUMONT
I ain't doin' you no way. I just
ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a
problem with small places.

ORDELL
Well, my ass has got a problem
spending ten thousand dollars of my
own goddam money to get ungrateful,
peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I
do it -

BEAUMONT
Look, man, I know I owe you -

ORDELL
- Well, if you owe me, git your ass
in the trunk.

BEAUMONT
- I wanna help you, but I don't wanna
be locked in the trunk of no car.

ORDELL
You think I wanted to spend ten
thousand dollars on your ass?
Beaumont starts to speak -

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Answer the question, nigga. Do you
think I wanted to spend the thousand
dollars on your ass? Yes or no?

BEAUMONT
Course you didn't.

ORDELL
But the only way to help you was to
do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,
how 'bout this? After we're through
fuckin' with these Koreans, I take
you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
My treat.
Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Just think, man. That Scoe's special,
smothered in gravy and onions. Get a
side of red beans and rice.
Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.
Beaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says;

BEAUMONT
Now exactly how long I gotta be in
this motherfucker.

CUT TO:

TRUNK
Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid
is SLAMMED closed.

EXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush
interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to
life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player
inside the dash.
The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."
Cool, old-school R&B fills the cab.
Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and
mouthing the words.
He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...
... then stops.
Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab
goes black.
He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.
In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his
right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the
glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes
the glovebox.
The cab goes black.

EXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban
nowhere.
Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and
walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the
trunk and says;

ORDELL
Don't worry. It's just me.
The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
shotgun.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I was wondering. Did any federal
people come visit you in jail and I
should be watching my ass?
Beaumont doesn't say anything.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
You wouldn't tell me if they did and
I wouldn't blame you.
Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.
Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He
racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in
the chest. He goes back into he trunk.
Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the
weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.
Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into
the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&B
song come back on, but VERY LOW.
Ordell drives the Olds away.

CUT TO:

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
Louis sits on a bed in a flophouse motel room, flipping
from one channel to another with a remote control,
drinking cocktails from a can.
The phone rings. He answers it.

LOUIS
Hello.

INT. OLDSMOBILE (PARKED) - NIGHT
Ordell is sitting parked in the comfy-cozy cab of the
Olds, listening to soul music with his tiny cellular
phone next to his ear.

ORDELL
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?

LOUIS
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.

ORDELL
Whatcha watchin'?

LOUIS
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back
and forth. They had some black girl
from some black show on Jay Leno. I
watched that for a bit, but I kept
flippin channels cause I didn't know
who she was.

ORDELL
Guess where I am?

LOUIS
I dunno.

ORDELL
I know you don't know. I said guess.

LOUIS
The moon - I dunno

ORDELL
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy-
cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked
outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.

LOUIS
You're outside?

ORDELL
Uh-huh.

LOUIS
C'mon in.

ORDELL
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm
comfortable. I ain't about to walk
into that roach motel and get
uncomfortable. You bring your ass out
here.

LOUIS
I'm in my underwear.

ORDELL
Then put your goddam drawers on, and
get your ass out here. I got
somethin' to show you.

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
Louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside
his room and sees Ordell's big, black Oldsmobile parked
in front of the motel.
As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side
comes down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back
in his seat looking up at Louis.

ORDELL
You know what your problem is, Louis?
Louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his
pockets.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
You think you're a good guy. When you
go into a deal you don't go in
prepared to take that motherfucker
all the way. You go in looking for a
way out. And it ain't cause you're
scared neither. It's cause you think
you're a good guy, and you think
there's certain things a good guy
won't do. That's where we're
different, me and you. Cause me, once
I decide I want something, aint a
goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop
me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun
get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.
Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get
removed. Understand what I'm saying?

CLOSEUP: KEY GOING INTO TRUNK
Trunk opens showing Beaumont shot in the chest with half
his head blown off.
Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then
back to Beaumont.
Ordell closes the trunk.

LOUIS
Who was that?

ORDELL
That was Beaumont.

LOUIS
Who was Beaumont?

ORDELL
An employee I had to let go.

LOUIS
What did he do?

ORDELL
He put himself in a situation where
he was gonna have to do ten years in
the penetentiary, that's what he did.
(taking out a Viceroy and
lighting it up)
And if you know Beaumont, you know
there aint no way in hell he can do
no ten years. And if you know that,
you know Beaumont's gonna go any
goddam thing Beaumont can to keep
from doin' those ten years including
telling the Federal government
everything they want to know about my
ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear
case of him or me. And you best
believe it aint gonna be me. You know
what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on
this with me, you gotta be prepared
to go all the way. I got me so far
over a half-a-million dollars sittin'
in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San
Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one
more delivery, I'm gonna have me over
a million. You think I'm gonna let
this little cheese eatin' nigga here
fuck that up? Shit, you better think
again. 'Fore I let this deal get
fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in
the head, and ten niggas look just
like em.
(pause)
Understand what I'm sayin'?

LOUIS
Yeah.

ORDELL
So we on the same page then?

LOUIS
I follow.
Ordell smiles (not his hustler smile, but a genuine
smile).
Louis grins.
They both bump fists.

FADE TO BLACK:

TITLE CARD:

"JACKIE BROWN"
The sound of airplanes landing and taking off can be
heard underneath this...

INT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
A SUBTITLE reads:

"LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE"
We look down a row of cars in an enclosed parking garage
at LAX. Jackie Brown, the Cabo Air stewardess from the
opening credits, walks into frame. We dolly behind her as
she walks down the row of cars.

VOICE (O.S.)
Miss Brown.
She turns towards the voice/camera.
Young plainclothes cop, MARK DARGUS, walks up to her,
holding open his I.D. case.

DARGUS
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus.
L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in
that bag?

JACKIE
The usual things. I'm a flight
attendant with Cabo Air.
Young plainclothes cop RAY NICOLET, enters the scene.

NICOLET
Can I be of some assistance?
As Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her
purse, she says to Ray;

JACKIE
I doubt it.
(to Dargus)
Who's your friend?

DARGUS
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
Would you mind if we looked in that
bag?
Jackie lights her cigarette with a yellow Bic lighter.

JACKIE
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?

DARGUS
You have the right to say "no." And I
have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while I go get a warrant.
And if I don't want to go through all
that trouble, I could just take you
in on suspicion.

JACKIE
Suspicion of what?

NICOLET
All he wants to do is peek in your
bag. I'll watch he doesn't take
anything.
Jackie shrugs and says;

JACKIE
Go ahead.
Dargus lays the flight bag on the pavement, gets down on
his haunches, and starts feeling through her things.

CLOSEUP FLIGHT BAG
A soiled blouse, uniform skirt, - then a manila envelope,
a fat one, nine-by-twelve.
Jackie watches him straighten the clasp...

ENVELOPE
Opens it. Out drops several packets of one hundred dollar
bills secured with rubberbands.
Nicolet whistles.
Dargus looks up at her.

DARGUS
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty
thousand dollars here. What would you
say Ray?

NICOLET
That looks like fifty thousand
dollars from here.

JACKIE
Not saying anything at the moment.

DARGUS
This is your money?

JACKIE
If I were to tell you "no it
isn't..."
Dargus smiles.

DARGUS
You should know if you bring in
anything over ten thousand you have
to declare it. You forgot or what?
You could get a two hundred and fifty
thousand dollar fine, plus two years
in prison. Now you want to talk to us
about it, or you want to talk to
Customs?

JACKIE
I'm not saying another word.

NICOLET
Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch
of fuckin' pricks in Customs.
Something about that job makes them
kinda hard to get along with. Now, do
you want to talk with a bunch of
suspicious, disagreeable people like
them, or a couple good-hearted guys
like Mark and myself.
Nicolet smiles.

CLOSEUP JACKIE
Doesn't smile back.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSEUP JACKIE
Sitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives.
Jackie lights up a cigarette. We don't leave the CLOSEUP
until noted.

INT. DARGUS OFFICE - DAY

DARGUS (O.S.)
Hey, this is my office. There's no
smoking.

JACKIE
Arrest me.
Nicolet laughs O.S.

DARGUS (O.S.)
We could, smart ass... or we could
work out what's known as a
Substantial Assistance Agreement.
That is if you're willing to
cooperate. Tell us who gave you the
money and who you're giving it to.
Jackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes.

NICOLET (O.S.)
You got a good lawyer?

DARGUS (O.S.)
Can she afford a good one is the
question. Otherwise she'll be in
Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
the Public Defender gets around to
her.

NICOLET (O.S.)
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
Livingston?
Not a word.

NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Don't know Beaumont? That's funny
'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he
did know you, Beaumont was found in
the trunk of a car - dead. Shot
twice. Once in the head and once in
the chest.
Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."

NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
yesterday. You see, like you,
Beaumont found himself in some hot
water. He was looking at ten years he
was pretty sure he didn't want to do
and was understandably concerned. Now
maybe you don't know Beaumont, but
Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does
the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.
Not a word.

DARGUS (O.S.)
If you don't want to talk to us, I
guess we'll just have to hand you
over to Customs.
Jackie puts out her cigarette.

JACKIE
Okay, let's go.
She stares down the cops.

DARGUS AND NICOLET
We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
first time in the scene.

DARGUS
You know, Miss Brown, there's
basically three types of people that
we come along in the performance of
our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
Victims, witnesses, innocent
bystanders... You ain't any of these.
Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
sonabitches have dedicated their
lives to a life outside the law. That
ain't you either. Where you belong is
the third category. The category we
refer to as LOSERS.
Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just
says without expression;

JACKIE
I'm not a loser.

DARGUS
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
flying for TWA and got busted for
carrying drugs. You were carrying
them for a pilot husband of yours. He
did time and you got off. But that
ended your career with the big
airlines. Cut to thirteen years
later. You're forty-four years of
age. You're flying for the shittiest
little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
Mexican airline that there is. Where
you make a whopping twelve-thousand
dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
lot to show for a twenty year career.
And to top it off, you're going to
jail. Now true, the judge, even with
your prior, will probably only give
you a year or two. But this doesn't
seem like the time of life you got
years to throw away.
(pause)
Now, we don't like trying losers like
they're criminals. But in the absence
of a criminal, we will try you. Now,
wasn't this money given to you by an
American living in Mexico by the name
of Cedric Walker?
Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.
Nicolet joins back in.

NICOLET
You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us
about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever
the hell it was he worked for out
here, he wouldn't say. Could it be
the same person you were supposed to
deliver this money to?
Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.
Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on
it.

DARGUS
I'd like your permission to open this
again. So we'll know exactly how much
money we're talkin' about here.
Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,
unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops
it on the desk.

JACKIE
Help yourself.

DARGUS
While you're at it, let me see what
else is in there. You mind?
She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.

JACKIE
My pocketbook.

DARGUS
What's in it?

JACKIE
Beauty products.
Nicolet takes the manila envelope.

NICOLET
I'll count the money.
Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and
packets in it.

DARGUS
What's this?

JACKIE
That's my diet shit.
Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.

DARGUS
Let's see what else is in there.
Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope.
His expression changes to a shit-eating grin.

NICOLET
Oh, Miss Brown?

JACKIE
Yeah?
Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
half-inch or so of white powder inside.

NICOLET
And what would this be, Sweet and
Low?

JACKIE
What the fuck is that shit?

NICOLET
I know what it looks like.

JACKIE
You planted that shit on me.
Nicolet and Dargus laugh at that.

JACKIE
Look, that shit ain't mine.

NICOLET
(to Dargus)
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but
how 'bout Posession with the Intent
to Distribute?

DARGUS
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with
all the cash, I think I could go with
Conspiracy to Traffic.

JACKIE
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'
about that fuckin' shit.

NICOLET
Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you
have a seat and tell us who might
know something about this fuckin'
shit.
Jackie just looks at the two grinning Cheshire cats as
the balance of power rolls over on her.

CUT TO:

EXT. TORRANCE MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
A Los Angeles County Jail bus pulls up behind the
Torrance Court House.

INT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY
Jackie, now wearing County Jail blues, sits next to
another BLACK WOMAN. Their hands cuffed together.
The bus stops. A rough-looking FEMALE COUNTY SHERIFF
unlocks the gate that encloses the prisoners. Then
explains in a you-better-do-exactly-what-I-say manner,
how they're going to leave the bus.

EXT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY
MANY WOMEN, including Jackie, all wearing county blues
and handcuffed to each other, exit the bus.
The SHERIFFS lead them into the back entrance to the
court house.

INT. HALLWAY COURTHOUSE - DAY
Dargus and Nicolet confer with the PUBLIC DEFENDER, an
attractive blonde woman in a nice business suit.

DARGUS
If she'll cooperate with us, we'll
turn possession with intent into
plain ol' Possession, and she can
bond outta here for one thousand
bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll
go for the Intent and request a
twenty-five-thousand dollar bond.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY
Jackie and the Public Defender. Jackie, in her county
blues; Public Defender in her nice suit.

JACKIE
You tell those guys they'll have to
do one helluva lot better than that
before I'll even say 'hi' to them.

PUBLIC DEFENDER
Well, that's the State's offer. If
you plead to possession and tell
L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your
bond will be set at one-thousand
dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will
request one at twenty- five thousand
based on your prior record and risk
of flight. If you don't post it or
don't know anyone who can, you'll
spend six to eight weeks in County
before your arraignment comes up.

JACKIE
Who's side are you on?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
I beg your pardon?

JACKIE
What if I plead guilty?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
And cooperate? You might get
probation.

JACKIE
If I don't cooperate?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
With the prior? You could get
anywhere from a year to five
depending on the judge. You want to
think about it? You got two minutes
before we're up.

COURT IN SESSION
It's a full schedule in court today. Jackie sits with a
bunch of other females wearing county blues in the
defendant's area (where the jury sits during a jury
trial)
Dargus and Nicolet sit in the courtroom.
The JUDGE reads the next case.

JUDGE
Brown. Case number 700324.
Jackie rises amongst the other defendants.
The P.D. rises.
Dargus, the arresting officer, rises.

JUDGE
The charge is possession of Narcotics
with the Intent to Distribute. How
does your client plead?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
She wishes to stand mute, your honor.

JUDGE
Very well...
(to Dargus)
... Detective Dargus - You're the
arresting officer in his case,
correct?

DARGUS
That's correct, your honor.

JUDGE
You have a recommendation for bail?

DARGUS
Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the
defendant's prior conviction and the
extreme possibility of flight due to
her occupation, the State requests a
bond of no less than twenty-five
thousand.
The Judge looks at the report, then at Jackie...

JUDGE
I'll set bond at ten thousand and set
the date of August 14th for the
arraignment.

JACKIE
When is that, your honor?

JUDGE
That's six weeks from now, Miss
Brown. We'll continue this matter
then. Owens, case 72242.
Jackie sits down.
Dargus sits down next to Nicolet. They smile and giggle
together.
Jackie sees them giggle like fifth graders. It fucking
pisses her off.

DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
We go from a CLOSEUP of a boiling Jackie, to a
perspective from the back of the courtroom.
We see Jackie in the defendant's area.
We see the two happy detectives walk past us on their way
out of the courtroom.

ORDELL
Sits in the back, watching the proceedings without any
expression. When he's seen enough, he stands up and out
of the shot leaving an EMPTY FRAME.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD

"MAX CHERRY"

FADE UP ON:

INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY
The bathroom door in Max's office. We hear a toilet flush
behind it. The door opens, and Max Cherry emerges,
zipping up his pants with a TV guide in his hand.
He looks up and stops dead.
Ordell sitting oh-so comfortably in the chair in front of
Max's desk.

ORDELL
Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you
wash your hands.
Max looks at Ordell, then takes his place behind his
desk.

MAX
Comfortable?

ORDELL
The door was opened, so I just came
right in.

MAX
I can see that. Why?

ORDELL
I got some more business for ya.

MAX
Oh, yeah? What did he do?

ORDELL (O.S.)
She is an airline stewardess. Got
caught coming back from Mexico with
some blow. They set her bond this
afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what
I was thinkin', you could use the ten
thousand you owe me from Beaumont and
move it over on to the stewardess.

MAX
The bond for possession is only a
thousand.

ORDELL
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'
it Possession with Intent. A black
woman in her forties gets busted with
less than two ounces on her, they
call that shit Intent. Same shit
happened to a movie star. It's
Possession.

MAX
It still sounds high.

ORDELL
She had, I believe it was... fifty
grand on her, too. There was a cop at
the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D.
wanted her bond set at twenty-five
thousand, saying there was a risk of
flight. Jackie being a stewardess and
all.

MAX
Before we start talking about
stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of
the way first.
Sitting back in the chair - almost grinning - but not
quite.

ORDELL
Somebody already did.

MAX
What?

ORDELL
You didn't hear?

MAX
Hear what?

ORDELL
Somebody with a grudge blew
Beaumont's brains out - hey, that
rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out.

MAX
Did the police contact you?

ORDELL
Very first motherfuckin' thing they
did. They see I put up a big money
bond on my boy, they start thinking
with that where-there's-smoke-there's
fire logic. They roust my ass outta
bed, ten o'clock in the morning.
Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half
to death. She thought they were gonna
take my ass away for sure.

MAX
The stewardess. Do you know her last
name?

ORDELL
(smiles)
Brown, Jackie Brown.

MAX
What does she do for you?

ORDELL
Who says she does anything for me?
She's my friend. When my friends get
into trouble, I like to help 'em out.

MAX
Beaumont worked for you.

ORDELL
That's what the police thought. I
told them I'm unemployed, how could I
have anybody work for me? Now I bail
out Jackie, I'm liable to have the
police on me again, huh? Wanting to
know was she doing things for me, was
she bringing me that money!

MAX
Was she?

ORDELL
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-
client relationship? The lawyer can't
tell nothing he hears?

MAX
You're not my client until you get
busted and I bond you out.

ORDELL
If there's no - what do you call it -
confidentiality between us? Why would
I tell you anything?

MAX
Cause you want me to know what a
slick guy you are. You got
stewardesses bringing you fifty
grand.

ORDELL
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
grand?

MAX
You want me to speculate on what you
do. I'd say you're in the drug
business, except the money's moving
in the wrong direction. Whatever
you're into, you seem to be getting
away with it, so more power to you.
Okay you want another bond, and you
want to move over the ten thousand
you put down on Beaumont to the
stewardess. That means paperwork. I
have to get a death certificate,
present it to the court, fill out a
receipt for return of bond
collateral, then type up another
application. An indemnity agreement -

ORDELL
- Jackie aint got time for all that
shit -

MAX
- I'm telling you what I have to do.
What you have to do, in case you
forgot, is come up with premium of a
thousand bucks.

ORDELL
I got it. I just don't got it on me.

MAX
Well, come back when you do, and I'll
bond out the stewardess.

ORDELL
Man, you know I'm good for it.
Thousand bucks ain't shit.

MAX
If I don't see it in front of me,
you're right. It ain't shit.

ORDELL
Man, you need to look at this with a
little compassion. Jackie ain't no
criminal. She ain't used to this
kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters
don't give a fuck - but for the
average citizen, coupla nights in
County fuck with your mind.

MAX
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you
don't have a tab.

ORDELL
Just listen for a second. We got a
forty-year-old, gainfully employed
black woman, falsely accused -

MAX
Falsely accused? She didn't come back
from Mexico with cocaine on her?

ORDELL
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had
that shit - and mind you, I said "if"
- it was just her shit to get high
with.

MAX
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?
Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket.

ORDELL
Okay, man. I got your money. But
don't you ever ask me for no fuckin'
favor.

INT. MAX'S CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT
It's early evening; and Max's powder-blue Seville is
driving to the County Jail with a client, a young
Hispanic woman of twenty named ANITA.

MAX
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation
officer. Karen's a good kid, but
she's mad at you, because you lied to
her. This business about your
grandmother's funeral

ANITA
I went. I did. I took my mother and
little brother.

MAX
But you didn't ask permission. You
broke a trust. If you had asked,
Karen probably would have let you.
I'm sure she would.

ANITA
I know. That's why I went.

MAX
But then you told her you were home.

ANITA
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I
could go.
Max gives up.

MAX
I don't know. Maybe it's a language
problem.
(getting stern)
Anita, you ever cause this much
heartache over something that could
easily be avoided, I'll never write
you again. You understand?

ANITA
I understand.

MAX
I mean it. I don't care how many
times your mother calls or how much
she cries.
Like an exasperated teenager.

ANITA
I understand.

MAX
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."

ANITA
Yes, Max, I understand.

INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT

POV THROUGH A WIRE MESH CAGE
Max and Anita, side by side. Anita's hands are cuffed
behind her back.

MAX
Dropping off and picking up. Dropping
of Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown,
Jackie.
We're at the admitting desk of the L.A. County Jail. Max
undoes Anita's handcuffs, while a SHERIFF waits to take
her away.

ANITA
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?

MAX
I'll call her.

ANITA
Won't forget?

MAX
I won't forget.
She kisses Max on the cheek and the Sheriff takes her
away.

ANITA
Thanks, Max. See you later.
Max puts the cuffs away, sits on a bench, takes out a Len
Deighton paperback and begins to read.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MAX
Still reading his novel. We hear offscreen, a SHERIFF'S
voice.

SHERIFF (O.S.)
Max! Here she comes.
Max puts his book down and see -
Jackie being led into the Admitting Area by TWO SHERIFFS.
She's wearing her stewardess uniform and carrying a small
envelope with her belongings in it and her shoes. When
Max was imagining a woman in her forties, he had someone
with a bit of wear and tear on them in mind. But this
Jackie Brown's a knockout.
As he watches her, she steps out of the County Jail
slippers she was wearing and slips into her shoes.
He approaches, handing her his card.

MAX
Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm
your bail bondsman.
She takes the card and shakes his hand saying nothing.

MAX (CONT'D)
I can give you a lift home if you'd
like?

JACKIE
Okay.

INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - NIGHT
Max puts his key in the ignition, when Jackie asks;

JACKIE
Are you really a bail bondsman?

MAX
Who do you think I am?
She doesn't answer.

MAX (CONT'D)
I gave you my card there.

JACKIE
Can I see your I.D.?

MAX
You're serious?
She waits.
Max digs the case out of his pocket, hands it to her,
then reaches up and turns on the light above them for her
to see.

MAX'S ID: SURETY AGENT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA

JACKIE
Who put up my bond? Ordell?

MAX
In cash.
She looks straight ahead.
Max shifts into drive.
Max rolls down his window at the front gate. A DEPUTY
comes out of the gatehouse and hands through the window
Max's .38 revolver, cylinder opened. Max hands the Deputy
his pass in exchange for the gun, says "thanks", then
puts the .38 in his glovebox in front of Jackie. He
drives on.

MAX AND JACKIE (MOVING)

JACKIE
Can we stop for cigarettes?

MAX
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?

JACKIE
I don't think so.

MAX
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.

JACKIE
Couldn't we just stop at a seven-
eleven?

MAX
I thought you might want a drink?

JACKIE
I'd love one, but not there.

MAX
We could stop at the Hilton by the
airport.

JACKIE
Is it dark?

MAX
It's kind of a sports bar

JACKIE
That doesn't sound dark.

MAX
Why does it need to be dark?

JACKIE
'Cause I look like I just got outta
jail, that's why. You droppin' me off
at home, right? There's a place by
me.

MAX
Great.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT
A big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick
inn.

INT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT
CLOSEUP - A KNOB is pulled out.
Jackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven's cigarettes from
the bottom of a cigarette machine. She crosses the bar to
join Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to
return.
The Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A
dark and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of
Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess
lives (about ten minutes from LAX)
The clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd
and an even older white crowd who'd been coming here
years before it became a black bar.
A JUKEBOX plays soft, old-school R&B.
Jackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by
a bar candle in a red glass thing.
Max drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks
white wine. Jackie opens her Mild Sevens, offering one to
Max.

MAX
No thanks, I quit three years ago.
As she lights her cigarette.

JACKIE
You gain weight?

MAX
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back
on.

JACKIE
That's why I don't quit. If I can't
fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch
of a time gettin' my brand.

MAX
What's your brand?

JACKIE
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico.
They're hard to find here. I was
locked up with the last two getting
legal advice from a woman who was in
for bustin' her boyfriend's head open
with a baseball bat.

MAX
Was she helpful?

JACKIE
She was more helpful than the fuckin'
Public Defender.
(she takes a sip of wine)
I don't know - I guess what I need is
a lawyer, find out what my options
are.

MAX
You know, I figured out the other day
I've written something like' fifteen
thousand bonds since I've been in the
business. I'd say about eighty
percent of them were at least drug
related. If you want, I can help you
look at your options.
Jackie takes the talk in a different direction.

JACKIE
You're not tired of it?

MAX
(smiles)
I am, as a matter of fact.
A moment of silence between them, they both take drinks.

MAX (CONT'D)
What have they told you?

JACKIE
So far I've been told I can cooperate
and get probation, maybe. Or, I can
stand mute and get as much as five
years. Does that sound right?

MAX
I'd say if you're tried and found
guilty you won't get more than a year
and a day. That's State time. Prison.

JACKIE
(under her breath)
Shit.

MAX
But they won't want to take you to
trial. They'll offer you simple
Possession, a few months of County
time, and a year or two probation.
(pointing to her drink)
How 'bout another?

JACKIE
Sure.
Max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named
ROWEN for two more.

MAX
You know who put the dope in your
bag?

JACKIE
Yeah, but that's not what this was
about. They were fuckin waitin' for
my ass. They knew I had that money,
they even knew the amount. The one
who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
"Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
here. What would you say?" But all
they could do was threaten me and
hand me over to Customs, and I could
tell they didn't want to do that.

MAX
They wanted you to tell them what you
know.

JACKIE
I had 'em too. I burnt those two
Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.
Then their asses lucked out and found
that coke.

MAX
What did they want to know?

JACKIE
Who gave me the money and who I was
giving it to. And some guy they found
in a trunk with his head blown off.
Said it was him who told them 'bout
me.
The Waitress comes with the drinks.

ROWEN
Can I get you two some popcorn?

MAX
No, thanks.
Rowen exits.

MAX (CONT'D)
That would be Beaumont Livingston.

JACKIE
That's him. How do you know 'em?

MAX
I wrote him on Monday. They found him
dead on Tuesday.

JACKIE
Ordell pick up his bond?

MAX
Same as you. Ten thousand.

JACKIE
The federal agent kinda half hinted
Ordell might of done Beaumont.

MAX
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D.,
but you didn't mention the Federal.

JACKIE
I didn't?

MAX
No, you didn't. What branch?

JACKIE
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms.
Max puts it together.

MAX
He's the one who wants you.

JACKIE
It was the other guy who busted me.

MAX
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play
hell bonding out of federal court. He
doesn't want you mad at him, he wants
you to tell him what you know. He
uses you to get a line on Ordell,
make a case, then take him federal.
You know what Ordell's into?

JACKIE
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's
smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
be interested in.
Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in
her mind and makes a decision.

JACKIE
I used to bring over ten thousand at
a time. That's the legal limit, so I
never brought more than that.

MAX
How many trips did you make?

JACKIE
With ten thousand? Nine.

MAX
He's got that kinda money?

JACKIE
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
bank. But he's got a problem. He's -
what do you call it when you got
money, but don't have cash?

MAX
Cash poor?

JACKIE
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on
me till I finally said okay. I'll
bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
twelve envelope. I got paid five
hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
Walker, in Mexico gave me the
envelope.

MAX
If you knew bringing anything over
ten thousand was against the law, why
not pack a hundred grand?
Jackie gets exasperated.

JACKIE
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
and not hit you in the face if the
bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my
problem. I gotta figure out a way to
either keep my job or get out of
trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't
leave the country I'm out of a job.
And if I don't got a job, I can't
hire a lawyer.

MAX
Ask A.T.F. They might give you
permission.

JACKIE
Yeah, if I cooperate.

MAX
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're
gonna have to give 'em something.

JACKIE
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's
name - I don't really know shit about
what he does or how he does it - That
don't give me much to bargain with.

MAX
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help.
Show a willingness to be helpful. You
want to stay out of jail, don't you?
Max looks at Jackie thinking about something.

MAX (CONT'D)
What'dya think?

CLOSEUP JACKIE

JACKIE
I think maybe I have more options
than I thought.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSEUP: ORDELL
Sitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street
from Jackie's apartment building in Hawthorne. Johnny
Cash is playing inside his car.

EXT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

ORDELL'S POV
Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue
Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets
out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window
of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture
and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives
off.

ORDELL
While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little
Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the
pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a
moment, then Jackie opens the door.

ORDELL
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?

JACKIE
I was expecting you. Come in.
Jackie holds the door open for him.

INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in
the living room.

ORDELL
You got some booze?
Jackie still standing by the door. She doesn't look
frightened.

JACKIE
I got some vodka in the freezer.

ORDELL
Got some o.j.?

JACKIE
Yeah.
Ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim.

ORDELL
Well, then, why don't you be a good
hostess and make me a screwdriver?

JACKIE
Sure.
Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her,
hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie
doesn't turn on the light.

ORDELL
You gonna thank me?
Taking a glass from the cupboard.

JACKIE
For what?

ORDELL
Who you think got your ass outta
jail?
Opening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes
and taking out vodka.

JACKIE
The same guy who put me in, thanks a
lot.

ORDELL
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's
our business.
Opens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She
takes out orange juice, then closes the door.

JACKIE
It wasn't mine.
Ordell has to stop and think.
Jackie makes screwdriver.

ORDELL
Oh, shit. I bet it was that present
Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.
Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in
there if you didn't. Oh, man, that
shit's uncalled for, baby, and I
apologize. I 'magine they asked you a
shitload of questions about it, huh?
All that money, want to know where
you got it?
Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell
handing him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell
takes it, continues to look at Jackie.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I'magine they asked who you givin' it
to, too.

JACKIE
They asked.

ORDELL
And what was your answer?

JACKIE
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.

ORDELL
You positive about that? You weren't
nervous and let something slip by
mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I
just gotta know.
Jackie says to his face;

JACKIE
You're not asking the right
questions.
Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes
over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,
then moves by the door, still standing and looking at
Ordell in the kitchen doorway.

JACKIE
Beaumont Livingston.

ORDELL
I knew it.

JACKIE
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.

ORDELL
Yeah?

JACKIE
I didn't tell 'em anything.
Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.

ORDELL
My name come up?
Jackie slowly shakes her head "no."
Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his
gloved hands on her shoulders.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
You say anything about me?
Jackie shakes her head "no."

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Well, that's mighty honorable of you.
Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her
throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with
his, but still shows no fear.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
This fella Beaumont, they say what
happened to him?

JACKIE
They told me.
At this moment the film becomes a:

SPLIT SCREEN
On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely
touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max
driving home in his Seville.

MAX IN CAR
Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his
face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the
night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
"WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I
COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.
Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in
Torrance.

ORDELL AND JACKIE

ORDELL
Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at
Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of
what he might say to keep from doin
some time. I'magine from time-to-time
they asked you a whole shitload of
questions. And you didn't give 'em no
answer?
Jackie shakes her head from side to side.
Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle
of her throat.

ORDELL
You scared of me?
Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes
leaving his. Reaches over the seat

ORDELL
You got a reason to be nervous with
me?
With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the
woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard
the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.
Ordell hears a CLICK.
Can't believe it.

MAX IN CAR
Max takes his keys, then to the glove box...

THE GLOVE BOX
The gun is gone.

MAX
Where is it?

A CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL'S CROTCH

ORDELL
Is that what I think it is?

JACKIE
What do you think it is?

CLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH

ORDELL
I think it's a gun pressing against
my dick.

JACKIE
You thought right... Now take your
hands from around my throat, nigga.
Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.

END OF SPLIT SCREEN
Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and
pushes him against the wall.

ORDELL
What the hell you doin'?

JACKIE
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him
the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his
pocket

ORDELL
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do
with you. I just carry that. You been
listenin' to them cops too much.

JACKIE
The cops didn't try and strangle my
ass.

ORDELL
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with
you.

JACKIE
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm
gonna unload both these
motherfuckers, you don't do what I
tell you. Understand what I'm saying?

ORDELL
Baby, I ain't come here -
She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.

JACKIE
I said, you understand what I'm
saying

ORDELL
I understand woman, damn!

JACKIE
Go sit over in that chair.
Ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch.
Ordell still tries bullshit...

ORDELL
I'm tellin' you, those cops been
fuckin' wit your mind. They turn
black against black, that's how they
do.

JACKIE
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
down.
Ordell sits.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Put both hands behind our head.
Ordell does...

ORDELL
This shits gettin silly now...
Jackie turns the halogen lamp to light.

JACKIE
I gotta tell you to shut up one more
time, I'm gonna shut you up.
Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each
hand, both pointed dead at Ordell.
A coffee table lays between them.
Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...

ORDELL
I just came here to talk.

JACKIE
Way I see it, me and you only got one
thing to talk about. What you willing
to do for me?
Ordell looks at her a moment and says;

ORDELL
Well, I can get you a good lawyer -
Jackie shakes her head "no!"

JACKIE
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or
later they're gonna get around to
offering me a plea deal, and you know
that. That's why you came here to
kill me.

ORDELL
- Baby, I didn't -

JACKIE
- It's okay. I forgive you. Now,
let's say if I tell on you, I walk.
And if I don't, I go to jail.
Ordell, very interested.

ORDELL
Yeah?

JACKIE
One hundred thousand put in an escrow
account in my name, if I'm convicted
up to a year, or put on probation. If
I have to do more than a year, you
pay another hundred thousand.
Ordell just takes in what the woman said.

ORDELL
I got a problem...

JACKIE
All your money's in Mexico.
Ordell has to smile at the woman.

ORDELL
Yeah.

JACKIE
I been thinkin about that, too, and I
got me a idea.

TIME CUT:

DOORWAY
Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps
into FRAME, and talks with him.

JACKIE
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and
tell you if it's on.

ORDELL (O.S.)
Talk to you tomorrow.
Ordell leaves.
Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.

FADE TO BLACK

OVER BLACK
We hear a knock-knock on the door.

FADE UP ON:

SAME SHOT DORWAY
Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME
and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera
visitor;

JACKIE
You want your gun, don't you? Come
in. I'll go get it.
She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
That'll change her expression, he'd bet.
She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort
of sad smile.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
asked to borrow it you'd say no.
You'd have to. Would you like some
coffee?
Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates
completely, leaving only curiosity.

MAX
If you're having some.

JACKIE
I am. Have a seat.
Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits
at the dining table off of the kitchen.

MAX
You get a chance to use it?

JACKIE
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk
went bad when I was in jail.

MAX
Black's fine.
She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
coffee in it.

MAX (CONT'D)
You want to hang on to it awhile? It
wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -
Jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.

JACKIE
Thanks, but I have my own now.

MAX
You went out this morning and bought
a gun?
She turns off the water.

JACKIE
What, I couldn't hear you?

MAX
You went out this morning and bought
a gun.
Pouring water into the coffee machine.

JACKIE
Let's just say I got one, okay?
She turns on the coffeemaker.

MAX
Somebody loan it to you?

JACKIE
Yeah.
Jackie leaves the kitchen.
Max's eyes follow her to the living room.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Want to hear some music?

MAX
Sure.
Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records
leaned up against the wall on the floor.

JACKIE
I couldn't wait till I got home last
night and wash my hair.

MAX
It looks nice.
She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo
turntable.

MAX (CONT'D)
You never got into the whole CD
revolution?

JACKIE
I got a few. But I can't afford to
start all over again. I got too much
time and money invested in my
records.
The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number
from the early seventies.

MAX
Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
records.
Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.

JACKIE
I don't buy new stuff that often.
Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
cigarette and stands.
Max listens to the soul song.

MAX
This is pretty.

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

MAX
Who is this?

JACKIE
The Delfonics.

MAX

'76?

JACKIE
'74, I think.

MAX
It's nice.
They listen for a moment.

JACKIE
I called in sick this morning. As far
as the airline knows, I'm still
available.

MAX
Are you?

JACKIE
I don't know yet. 'm going to talk
with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
what you suggested. Offer to help and
see what happens.

MAX
What I meant was have a lawyer do the
negotiating for you.

JACKIE
I want to talk to them first. I know
more now about Ordell's money.

MAX
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
who wants you, that'll only interest
him up to a point.

JACKIE
It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
million dollars. All of it in Cabo in
safe deposit boxes and more comin in.

MAX
How'd you find that out?

JACKIE
He told me last night.

MAX
He called you?

JACKIE
He came by.

MAX
What?... What'd you do?

JACKIE
We talked.
Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there,
but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
He had his doubts at first. But he's
always trusted me an wants more than
anything to believe he still can.

MAX
Why?

JACKIE
He needs me. Without me all that
money is just gonna sit over there in
Cabo. Sugar?

MAX
No thanks. There's gotta be other
ways to get it out.
She pours the coffee.

JACKIE
Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever
used. He can't trust his other
people. They're crooks. He can try
bringing I in himself, but Ordell
sure don't want to go through no
Customs line. Either he recruits
another Cabo stewardess, or he
continues to trust me. I made him
feel he still can.
Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
sits down.

MAX
How do you get it out?

JACKIE
Same way I been don', but first they
got to let me go back to work.

MAX
You're gonna offer to set him up?

JACKIE
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck
'em.

MAX
It's very possible Ordell's killed
somebody.

JACKIE
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't
doin' that probation thing again.
Max watches her a moment
Jackie takes a drink of coffee.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
How do you feel about getting old?

MAX
You're not old. You look great.

JACKIE
I'm asking how you feel. Does it
bother you?

MAX
It's not really something I think
about.

JACKIE
Really?

MAX
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my
hair. It started falling out ten
years ago. So I did something about
it.

JACKIE
How'd you feel about it?

MAX
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of
done it, I did it to feel better
about myself, and I do. When I look
in the mirror it looks like me.

JACKIE
It's different with men.

MAX
You know, I can't really feel too
sorry for you in that department.
Jackie smiles.

MAX (CONT'D)
In fact, I'd make a bet that except
possibly for an Afro - you look
exactly the same as you did at twenty
nine.
Jackie smiles into her coffee.

JACKIE
My ass ain't the same.

MAX
Bigger?

JACKIE
Yeah.
Max smiles.

MAX
Nothin wrong with that.
Jackie's smile grows bigger.

MAX (CONT'D)
Does something else worry you?

JACKIE
I just feel like I'm always starting
over. You said how many bonds you
wrote?

MAX
Fifteen thousand.

JACKIE
Well, I've flown seven million miles.
And I've been waitin' on people
almost twenty years. The best job I
could get after my bust was Cabo Air,
which is about the worst job you can
get in this industry. I make about
sixteen thousand, with retirement
benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
now with this arrest hanging over my
head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I
gotta start all over again, but I got
nothin to start over with. I'll be
stuck with whatever I can get. And
that scares me more than Ordell.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
A.T.F. man, Ray Nicolet, moves down the hallway of the
big building... ten heads for the office of Mark Dargus.
He reaches the closed door... raps on it.

DARGUS (O.S.)
Come in.
Nicolet opens the door, revealing Dargus and Jackie Brown
sitting in the office talking.

DARGUS (CONT'D)
Great, you're here.

NICOLET
Hey, Jackie.
Jackie waves.
Dargus stands up and says to Jackie;

DARGUS
Let me have a word outside with Agent
Nicolet for a moment?

JACKIE
Take your time.

DARGUS
Thanks.

NICOLET
Well just be a minute.

JACKIE
Can I smoke?

DARGUS
Go ahead.
The two detectives step outside and close the door on
Jackie as she pulls out her cigarettes.

NICOLET
What's going on?

DARGUS
She wants to make a deal.

NICOLET
She sound scared?

DARGUS
She almost sounds scared.

NICOLET
What's she want?

DARGUS
She wants to go back to work.

NICOLET
What's she willing to give us?

DARGUS
She hasn't one into specifics yet,
she's been waiting for you.

NICOLET
She knows it's my case?

DARGUS
She ain't said it, but she's not
stupid, she knows it's you who wants
her.

CLOSEUP JACKIE
Inside Dargus' office, smoking a Mild Seven.
Dargus and Nicolet come back inside.

NICOLET
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell
me, what can we do for you?

JACKIE
I need permission to leave the
country so I keep my job.

NICOLET
We can look into that.

JACKIE
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show
up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.

NICOLET
You know what we want.

JACKIE
If I'm working, I can help you.

DARGUS
Help us do what?

JACKIE
Help you get Ordell Robbie.

NICOLET
Oh, so now you know him?

JACKIE
You never asked me if I did or not.

DARGUS
But now you're telling us now you do.

JACKIE
'Course I do - I deliver money for
him.

NICOLET
No shit. You know how he makes hi
money?

JACKIE
He sells guns.

NICOLET
You ever see him sell guns?

JACKIE
No.

NICOLET
Then how do you know he sells guns?

JACKIE
He told me. Besides, why else would
an A.T.F. man be after him?

NICOLET
How can you help us?

JACKIE
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do
everything I can to help you throw
his ass in jail. And in exchange for
my help, I need permission to leave
the country and immunity.

DARGUS
You don't want much, do you?

JACKIE
Can you do it or not?
The two cops look at each other.

DARGUS
(to Nicolet)
It's your call.
Nicolet looks at Jackie.

NICOLE
It's possible.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"LOUIS GARA & MELANIE"

CUT TO:

FADE UP ON ON TV
Helmut Berger slaps a woman in the face with a newspaper,
proclaiming he's the "mad dog." The film is an Italian
Policier from the seventies.
Melanie sits in a comfy chair long-ways, bare legs
hanging over the arm. As she watches the TV, she picks up
a big bong with it's own handle. He takes a hit.
Melanie's dressed in her usual Melanie-uniform of shorts
and a loose top.
The front door opens, and Ordell and Louis walk through
it carrying shopping bags.

ORDELL
We're back.

MELANIE
'Ola!
We notice that Louis is sportin' new duds. Louis' new
"look" is a retro seventies-style bowling shirt and black
jeans.
Melanie notices the change.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got
some new clothes.

ORDELL
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy
running around lookin' like a bum on
the street.

LOUIS
I didn't look like a bum.

ORDELL
But you did have a Salvation Army-
thing going.
Ordell notices the bong in her hand and the smoke in the
air.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Goddam, girl. You gettin' high
already. It's only two o'clock.
Melanie smiles.

MELANIE
It's that late?
Louis sits on the couch. He smiles at the comeback.

ORDELL
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too
much of that shit. That shit robs you
of your ambition.

MELANIE
Not if your ambition is to get high
and watch TV.
Melanie and Louis laugh.
The phone rings.

ORDELL
You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs,
ain't ya.
(he moves towards the
phone - to Melanie)
Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.
He picks it up.

ORDELL
Hello.
(pause)
Hey, Jackie...
(throwing a hard look at
Melanie)
No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.

MELANIE
I was gonna tell you...
Ordell gives her a "silence" gesture and look.
Melanie trades a look with Louis like "I'm in trouble,"
all the while smiling like a shark.
Louis smiles to himself.
Melanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit.
Ordell's on the phone.

ORDELL
No, not on the phone, let's meet
somewhere. But you gotta make sure
they ain't followin' you...
Louis has the bong in front of him.
Melanie stays in her chair long-ways.

LOUIS
Is it ready to go?

MELANIE
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Louis takes it.
Ordell's on the phone.

INT. COCKATOO INN
Jackie sits at the bar talking on their phone. We see
both sides.

JACKIE
The Cockatoo Inn.

ORDELL
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?

JACKIE
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and
Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red
brick...

ORDELL
Oh, wait, you mean that place that
has the big sign with a rooster on
it?

JACKIE
It's a cockatoo.
Louis exhales his smoke, does an older man cough.

MELANIE
You okay?

LOUIS
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't
smoke or laugh now it seems without
coughing.

MELANIE
Coughing opens up the capillaries.
When you cough, you're getting air -
in this case smoke - to parts of the
lung that don't normally get used.
Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My
dad coughs when he smokes all the
time.
Ordell hangs up the phone.

ORDELL
(to Louis)
Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.
So since you like gettin' high so
much, why don't you stay here with
Melanie, get high, and watch
cartoons?
Louis with a smile.

LOUIS
Way ahead of you.
Melanie laughs.
Ordell takes the remote control and turns the station
till he finds a channel with cartoons.

ORDELL
So you just watch this for the next
three hours, and I'll be back. Then,
when I'm through with all my
business, I'll get high. I get high
at night. Walk me to the door, space
girl.
Melanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the
door,
Ordell says to her in the doorway;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Hope you don't mind keeping him
company.

MELANIE
No problem.

ORDELL
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em
they're new.
Melanie gives him a sarcastic, "Oh, you're so funny"
look.
Ordell kisses her quick on the mouth, then says past her;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I'll be back in an hour, man. Just
hang with Mel.
Ordell leaves and Melanie closes the door. She turns
around and looks at Louis.

MELANIE
Want a Metrix?

LOUIS
What's a Metrix?
She crosses to the kitchen.

MELANIE
It's like this major meal in a shake
you drink instead of having a big
meal.

LOUIS
It's a diet thing?

MELANIE
No, it's what body builders drink to
beef up.

LOUIS
No thanks.
She goes into the kitchen and starts making her Metrix
shake.
He looks around and spots something interesting.

TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS
In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about
sixteen wearing roller-disco skates. Melanie, in a green
setting, about five years ago, wearing a pretty Oriental-
style dress, with a "smile for the camera" look on her
face. The photo was obviously a picture of Melanie with
somebody else that's been cut in half. Somebody's
disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder.
Louis picks up the photo frame.

LOUIS
How old were you here?
She looks and sees what he's talking about.

MELANIE
Which one?

LOUIS
The roller disco one.

MELANIE
Fourteen.
Louis walks over.

LOUIS
You're fourteen years old here?

MELANIE
Yeah.

LOUIS
I thought you were sixteen.

MELANIE
I was pretty much the same height now
as I was then.

LOUIS
Were you a disco girl?

MELANIE
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,
I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to
discos.

LOUIS
So where did you go?

MELANIE
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at
a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.
girl. I hated disco.
She hits Whip on her blender. It makes an infernal noise
till she hits Stop!
Carrying the blender full of Metrix, she walks over and
looks at the picture.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
That was taken at a place called
"Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were
you in L.A. back then?

LOUIS
No.

MELANIE
Where were you?

LOUIS
Detroit.

MELANIE
With Ordell?

LOUIS
We had done time together already.
Melanie drinks her Metrix.

MELANIE
Were you a disco guy?

LOUIS
No.

MELANIE
C'mon, don't lie.

LOUIS
I don't like dancing.

MELANIE
Did you ever go I one?

LOUIS
I went to a few just to meet women.
But I don't like to dance, and it's
so fuckin; loud. During that whole
scene I just drank in bars.
(he points to the cut
picture)
Who didn't make the cut?

MELANIE
That's a picture of me in Japan.

LOUIS
You been to Japan?

MELANIE
I lived there for about nine months.

LOUIS
You lived in Japan, when?

MELANIE
About five years ago.

LOUIS
Who's arm is that?

MELANIE
That's the guy I lived with... his
name was... Hir.Hirosh.

LOUIS
Must of made quite an impression.

MEALINE
I never got to know him, really. I
couldn't speak Japanese, and his
English was terrible. But I couldn't
say anything, because his English was
better than my Japanese.

LOUIS
That sounds like a problem.

MELANIE
Not really. We didn't have much to
say to each other anyway. I never got
to know him that well, but I knew
enough to know I wasn't missing much.
I keep that, because of all the
fuckin' time I was there, that's the
only picture I got of me in Japan.
(she points beyond her
shoulder)
That's Japan.
Melanie looks up at Louis.

MELANIE
Wanna fuck?

LOUIS
Sure.

FADE TO BLACK

OVER BLACK

SUBTITLE:

"THREE MINUTES LATER"

FADE UP:

LOUIS
Lies on the couch on his back and Melanie sits on top of
him. They're going at it like a couple of fuck monkeys.
Almost on the fade up, Louis cums.

MELANIE
That was fun.
She hops off and OUT OF FRAME.

LOUIS
Yeah, that really hit the spot.

MELANIE (O.S.)
Now that's over, let's get to know
each other.

INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY
CLOSEUP a rack of CDs all beginning with "D" are flipped
through, till it stops on one CD, "The Best of the

DELFONICS."
Max is standing in he soul music section o a music store.
He lifts out the CD and turns it over.
It has the song Jackie played this morning.
He smiles and takes the CD up to the register.
CLOSEUP the COCKATOO INN neon sign, unlit during the day.

INT. THE COCKATOO INN - DAY
Ordell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the
middle of the day and sees Jackie sitting at the bar
drinking a white wine. Old-school soul plays on the
jukebox. He sits next to her.

ORDELL
I gotta remember this place. This is
all right. Two minutes from your
crib, ten minutes from your work. Not
bad...
A black bartender named FLOYD approaches Ordell.

FLOYD
What's your drink, brother?

ORDELL
Screwdriver.

FLOYD
(to Jackie)
How you doin'?

JACKIE
I'm fine.

FLOYD
Yes, you are.
Jackie smiles.
Floyd makes Ordell's drink.

ORDELL
I bet you come here on a Saturday
night, you need nigga repellent keep
'em off your ass.

JACKIE
I do okay.

ORDELL
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I
bet you do a damn sight better than
okay. You think anybody followed you?

JACKIE
I don't think so, but it don't really
matter. They know I'm meeting you.

ORDELL
How the fuck they know that?

JACKIE
I told them.
Floyd comes back with Ordell's screwdriver.

FLOYD
Three twenty-five.
Ordell digs in his pocket and gives Floyd a five.

ORDELL
Keep it.

FLOYD
Thank you, sir.
Floyd leaves.

ORDELL
(to Jackie)
You told em? You told em it's me?

JACKIE
They already know it's you.

ORDELL
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta
confirm it!

JACKIE
Look, the only way I can get
permission to fly is if I agree to
help them. Which is what I have to
appear to be doing. So I give them
something they already know. You.

ORDELL
Didja tell 'em anything else?

JACKIE
I told them you got a half a million
dollars in Mexico, and you want me to
bring it here.
Ordell freaks.

ORDELL
You told them that?

JACKIE
It's true, isn't it?

ORDELL
What the fuck's that got to do with
it?

JACKIE
They know I'm delivering for you. I
mention the half-million - they don't
give a fuck about that - They want
you with guns. So I say, well, if you
want proof he's getting paid for
selling them, let me bring the money
in.

ORDELL
What did they say?
Jackie smiles.

JACKIE
Yes.
Ordell smiles.
They both slap palms.

CUT TO:

INT. MELANIE'S BEACH APARTMENT - DAY
CLOSEUP - Louis taking a hit off Melanie's bong.
Louis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking
back, taking bong hits.
As Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks;

MELANI
... so first he tries to get into the
cocaine business but realizes right
away that shit's too competitive.
Piss the wrong person off, you get
shot. So he says, fuck that - moves
over to guns. You can sell guns
wherever there's a demand. No one
gives a shit. He acts like he's this
big international arms dealer, when,
come on, the only people he ever sold
to were dopers.
Louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across
the coffee table to Melanie.

LOUIS
He seems to be making out.
Referring to the bong.

MELANIE
Is it dead?

LOUIS
Yeah.
She starts preparing a bowl.

MELANIE
Well, so far he is. But you have to
admit he's not too bright.

LOUIS
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Melanie still preparing her bowl.

MELANIE
He moves his lips when he reads, what
does that tell ya. Let's say he's
streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's
still a fuck-up.
She takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then
while holding in the smoke, says;

MELANIE (CONT'D)
He killed a man worked for him the
other night.

LOUIS
So what are you trying to tell me? I
should get out of here?
Melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her
shark smile.

MELANIE
That's not what I'm saying at all.
(pause) You know where he went?

LOUIS
No.

MELANIE
He went to meet that stewardess.

LOUIS
Does that bother you?
Melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh.

MELANIE
Please.

LOUIS
You live with him.

MELANIE
I live here. He drops in and out. He
tell you about that half-million
dollars he's got in Mexico?

LOUIS
Uh-huh?

MELANIE
Course he did, he tells everybody
who'll listen. That's what he's doin'
with this stewardess. He's scheming
how he can get it over here.

LOUIS
And your point is?

MELANIE
Let him and that stewardess get that
money over here...

LOUIS
Uh-huh?

MELANI
... and just take it from him.

INT. COCKATOO INN - DAY
Jackie explaining the plan to Ordell.

JACKI
... I make two deliveries. The first
one with ten thousand, like a dry
run. They watch it. See how it works.
Then we do a second delivery, when I
bring in the half mill.

ORDELL
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I
ain't goin anywhere near that money.

JACKIE
You don't have to. I told 'em you're
real careful. You never pick up money
yourself. You always send someone,
and I never know who it is.

ORDELL
That's a good idea.

JACKIE
If you just listen, you'll see it's a
damn good idea. The first time I do
it they're lurking about. They see me
hand the ten thousand to someone.

ORDELL
Who?

JACKIE
I don't know. One of your friends.

ORDELL
A woman.

JACKIE
If you want.

ORDELL
Yeah, I think a woman.

JACKIE
The next trip, when I come with all
the money, it'll look like I hand it
to the same one I did before...

ORDELL
But you don't?

JACKIE
No, I give it to someone else first.

ORDELL
And they follow the wrong one
thinkin' she's bringing it to me.

JACKIE
That's the idea.

ORDELL
So we need two people, two women.

JACKIE
Can you cover that?

ORDELL
I got the woman covered. Where you
thinkin' about doin' this?

JACKIE
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In
the food court.

ORDELL
I suppose you see a piece of this for
yourself?

JACKIE
Well, it's my plan. We're in this
together.

ORDELL
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
need me a partner.

JACKIE
I ain't your partner, I'm your
manager. I'm managing to get your
money out of Mexico, into America, in
your hands, and I'm managing to do
all this under the nose of the cops.
That makes me your manager, and
managers get fifteen percent.

ORDELL
Managers get ten percent.

JACKIE
That's an agent. Manager's get
fifteen percent.

ORDELL
I'll give ya ten.

JACKIE
Plus the same deal as before.

ORDELL
I can do that.
They clink their glasses together.

CLOSEUP DIGITAL CLOCK
It flips to 11:00 P.M.
It's now getting late at night. Jackie comes home. She's
dressed differently than she was at the Cockatoo. In
fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date.
She walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes...
takes her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by
the bed... she sees that her answering machine is
flashing. She hits play.
We begin a SLOW ZOOM into the answering machine. Never
seeing Jackie again.
The machine voice says;

MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
You have on message. Sent at 8:06

P.M.
Max's voice comes out of the machine.

MAX'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just
calling to find out how everything
went today with A.T.F. If you want to
call me, my home number is 555-6788,
or you can reach me at my office,
which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's also on
the card I gave you when we first met
- I don't know if you still have that
- but it's on it - Oh, let me give
you my beeper number. It's 555-7839.
Okay, so I'll talk to you later. Hope
everything's well. Bye-bye.

MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
End of message.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP ON:

EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
We se the huge Del Amo Mall from the parking area.
A SUBTITLE reads:

"DEL AMO MALL TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA LARGEST INDOOR MALL IN

THE WORLD"

INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
The Del Amo Mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the
week. A few people, mostly black, mill around, but it's
not like it is on the weekend.
The international food court, where fast-food versions of
international cuisine are available to all the hungry Del
Amo Mall shoppers.
Jackie and Ordell sit at a table in the food court. She
drinks an iced tea from Teriyaki Donut. A collection of
Broadway shopping bags sit on the table.
We join in mid-conversation.

JACKIE
The money's in a Broadway shopping
bag. I get some food, and sit down
here in the food court. Then your
girl comes - you got somebody yet?

ORDELL
Uh-huh.

JACKIE
Who?

ORDELL
What'd you care?

JACKIE
Look, it's my ass facin' the
penitentiary. You send some hard-
headed roc whore, and she fucks
things up.

ORDELL
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The
woman's cool, I promise.

INT. DEL AMO MALL - U.A. CINEMAS - DAY
We're outside the Del Amo UA Cinemas, a six-screen
theater that's been in the Del Amo Mall since the early
seventies. A small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema,
having just watched their matinee. Max Cherry is among
them. He exits the theater, and strolls through the mall.

BACK TO JACKIE AND ORDELL
In the food court.
Ordell rises from the table.
Jackie moves a Broadway bag towards him.

JACKIE
Don't forget your bag.
He takes it.
We follow with Ordell out of the food court, when he
stops...
... He see Max Cherry strolling through the mall.
Ordell almost steps into a store to get out of view.
"What the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?"
As Ordell watches, he sees Max head towards the food
court.

MAX
walks into the food court. He stands
looking a all the international fast
food choices in front of him. As he
tries to decide, he hears from behind
him;

JACKIE (O.S.)
Max.
Max turns and sees Jackie siting there drinking her iced
tea, smoking her Mild Seven, and smiling up at him.
Max smiles back.

MAX
Well, hello.

JACKIE
Surprise.
He approaches her table.

MAX
I walked right past you.

JACKIE
I know, ignoring me. What're you up
to?

MAX
Catching a movie.

JACKIE
What'd ya see?

MAX
"American Prseident"

JACKIE
How was it?

MAX
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening
are goin steady.

JACKIE
Oh, are you? Does she know that?

MAX
No...
(sitting down at the
table)
... I don't believe she's ever heard
of me. But that doesn't mean we're
not going steady.

BACK TO ORDELL
Watching Max sit down and make himself comfortable at
Jackie's table.

ORDELL
(to himself)
What's up with this shit.

BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE

MAX
I think falling in live with movie
stars is something that happens to a
man as he gets older.

JACKIE
Does it happen to all men?

MAX
Well, I'd never be so bold as to
speak for all men, but as or myself
and a few of my friends, that's
definitely the case. There's a lot of
actresses out there you like, and
there's some you have crushes on. But
there's always one who you love. And
with her it's sorta like going
steady.

JACKIE
And Annette's it for you?

MAX
For now. These relationships never
last too long.
With a smile on her face;

JACKIE
That's a goddam man for ya. Can't
even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
star.
Max smiles.

JACKIE
Who was your girl before Annette?

MAX
Sandra Bullock. You know her?

JACKIE
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the
bus in "Speed." She's cute.

MAX
She's adorable. But I had to end it.

JACKIE
Why?

MAX
I'm old enough to be her father.

JACKIE
How old's Annette?

MAX
I don't care.
Gesturing to the Broadway bags on the table.

MAX
What're you, a bag lady?

JACKIE
I go back to work tomorrow.

MAX
You talk them into it?

JACKIE
They seem to like the idea.

MAX
Bring the money in and they follow
it?

JACKIE
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.
Put the money in a shopping bag and
hand it to someone I meet here.

MAX
You don't actually do it that way?

JACKIE
He always just picked it up at my
place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
want to stage it. You know, make it
look more intriguing, like we know
what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to
follow the shopping bag.

MAX
Make the delivery somewhere in the
mall.

JACKIE
Right around here, in the food court.

MAX
Sit down, leave the bag under the
table?
Jackie nods her head "yes."

MAX (CONT'D)
Will Ordell go for that?

JACKIE
I'm helping him bring his money into
America. He loves the idea. You just
missed him.

MAX
He was here?

JACKIE
Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
That's why all the bags.

MAX
I called you last night.

JACKIE
I know, I got your message. Ray
wanted to have dinner. He wanted to
talk about the sting we're plotting.
That's what he calls it. A sting.
He's being real nice to me.

MAX
You think he's got a thing for you?

JACKIE
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
something like he wants the money for
himself.

MAX
I don't follow your logic. What does
his being nice to you have to do with
him wanting Ordell's money?

JACKIE
He's setting me up to make a
proposition.

MAX
I see.

JACKIE
You don't propose something like that
unless you're pretty sure the other
person's into it.

MAX
Has he hinted around?

JACKIE
Not really. But I knew this narcotics
cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
the whole package never gets back to
the station. His exact words.

MAX
You know some interesting people.

JACKIE
We weren't bullshittin' either,
'cause later he was suspended and
forced to retire.

MAX
Has Nicolet told you any colorful
stories like that?
She shakes her head "no."

JACKIE
He tries to act cool.

MAX
No harm in that. He's a young guy
havin' fun being a cop. I know the
type, trust me on this. He's more
interested in Ordell than the money.
If he's gonna do anything suspect,
it'll be cutting corners to get the
conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
with the money. It's evidence.

JACKIE
What about you Max?

MAX
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?

JACKIE
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you
were somebody else.

MAX
If I saw a way to walk off with a
shopping bag full of money, would I
take it?

JACKIE
You know where it came from. It's not
like it's anybody's life savings. It
wouldn't even be missed.

MAX
A half-a-million dollars will always
be missed.

JACKIE
You're avoiding the question.

MAX
Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
Especially now, since I'm getting out
of the bail bonds business.
Jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she
doesn't say anything.
Max continues.

MAX
I have to stand behind all my active
bonds, but I'm not writing any new
ones.

JACKIE
Why?

MAX
A lot of reasons. But the main one
would be I'm tired of it.

JACKIE
When did you decide?

MAX
It's been a long time coming. I
finally made up my mind - I guess it
was Thursday.

FLASH ON:

A RELEASE FORM
With a date on it. Jackie's hand is signing her name. We
WHIP UP and se her face, just as Max Cherry approaches
her, handing her his business card.

MAX
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail
bondsman.

BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE

JACKIE
The day you got me out of jail?

MAX
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a
guy. I hear he's staying at this
house, so I sneak in, wait for him to
come home.

JACKIE
Wait a minute. After we were together
you went and snuck into a guy's
house?

MAX
Uh-huh.

FLASH ON
Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
goodbye.

MAX (V.O.)
I dropped you off...
Max finding no gun in his glove box.

MAX (V.O.)
Went to my office, found out you took
my gun...
Max in his office, taking another pistol from his drawer,
and a stun gun.

MAX (V.O.)
Got another gun and a stun gun...

BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE

MAX
And went to this guy's house in El
Monte, and I waited for him.

JACKIE
What do you do when he comes home?

MAX
Shoot him with the stun gun. While
he's incapacitated, cuff him, take
'em to County.

JACKIE
You do that?

MAX
That's my job.

JACKIE
Did you do it that night?

MAX
He never came home. But I'm sitting
on the couch, in the dark, holding my
stun gun and the whole house smells
of mildew - So after a couple hours I
think, "What am I doing here?
Nineteen years of this shit? So I
made up my mind, that's it.

JACKIE
And is that it?

MAX
More or less.
Jackie takes a pause before saying;

JACKIE
I'm not sure you answered my
question.

MAX
Which one?

JACKIE
If you had a chance, unemployed now,
to walk off with a half-million
dollars, would you take it?

MAX
I believe I said I'd be tempted.
Jackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke.

MAX
Don't even think about it. You could
get yourself killed go to prison...

CLOSEUP JACKIE

JACKIE
What if I've figured a way?
Hold for a few beats, then...

FADE TO BLACK.

TITLE CARD:

"MONEY EXCHANGE 10,000"
Over this card, we hear an airplane landing.

FADE UP:

CLOSEUP JACKIE
Back at work, standing at the exit of her plane. All the
passengers are filtering out. She says goodbye.

JACKIE
Bye bye... Bye now... Goodbye Bye
bye... Bye bye... Goodbye

INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY
Jackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the
LAX parking structure, pulling her bad on wheels behind
her.
Nicolet and Dargus are waiting for her.

NICOLET
We gotta stop meeting this way.
Jackie smiles. They all fall in step towards Jackie's
Honda.

INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY
The two cops and the black woman sit parked in her Honda.
She, behind the wheel, Nicolet next to her in the
passenger seat, Dargus in the backseat. Nicolet has the
flight bag in his lap. He's taking out the manila
envelope with the ten thousand inside. Their demeanor is
very different from the first time they met. The three
now almost act like friends.

DARGUS
How was your flight?

JACKIE
Fine.

DARGUS
Bet you're happy to be working again.

NICOLET
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet,
Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money
exchange trial run. It's three p.m.,
July 4th 1997. The location is the
parking structure at LAX.

JACKIE
What are you doing?
Pointing to a small mike on his lapel.

NICOLET
I'm recording this.

JACKIE
I thought you were going to let this
one through.

DARGUS
We are. Don't worry about it.

NICOLET
Every step of this goes in my report.
(back to report voice)
I am now taking a manila envelope
from the subject's flight bag.
He opens it and takes out the ten thousand dollars.

NICOLET (CONT'D)
The envelope contains currency... all
the same denomination, one-hundred-
dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.

DARGUS
What time do you have to be there?

JACKIE
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.

DARGUS
What's her name?

JACKIE
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow
her?

DARGUS
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.

JACKIE
But you're not going to stop her?
Nicolet finishes counting, then hushes them up.

NICOLET
The envelope contains ten thousand
dollars. The subject will be
delivering the currency in a...

JACKIE
A Broadway shopping bag.
She holds it up.

NICOLET
A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag
with handles and brown lettering.

EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
The huge Del Amo Mall.

INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
The Del Amo Mall on another lazy midday in the middle of
the week.
Max rides up an escalator in the mall. He casually
strolls through the mall, goes into a cappuccino bar
called "BUSTA CAP" across from the food court. Walking up
to the counter;

MAX
Cafe mocha.

BUSTA CAP GIRL
You want whipped cream on that?

MAX
No, thanks.
Max checks his watch: 4:30. He looks over at the food
court and spots Jackie sitting at a table by herself.

FLASH ON:

INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Jackie on the phone with Max, dressed for bed (long t-
shirt and panties).

JACKIE
Think of it as money that shouldn't
even be here. I mean does anybody
have a right to it?

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
Max in his office on the phone.

MAX
The feds. It's evidence.

JACKIE
It may be evidence once they get
their hands on it, but right now it's
only money.

BACK TO MAX AT THE MALL
He ponders his words as he watches her from a distance.

INT. FOOD COURT - DAY
Jackie sits at a table by herself, eating Japanese food
from Teriyaki Donut and drinking an iced tea. As she eats
she hears;

YOUNG GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Is this seat taken?
Jackie looks up and sees a skinny YOUNG GIRL, black,
quite pretty, no older than twenty.
She holds a tray filled with tacos, enchiladas, rice and
beans and a giant-sized Coke. She also has a Broadway
shopping bag hanging from her arm.

JACKIE
Have a seat.
The Young Girl does.
Jackie looks at her tray of food.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
You're hungry?

YOUNG GIRL
Yes'm.
It would seem our Young Girl's from the South.

JACKIE
Put your bag on the floor, okay?
Under the table, right next to mine.
The Young Girl who hasn't looked right at Jackie since
sitting down, bends sideways to glance under the table.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Then when I leave, well, you know.
What's your name?
She looks up...

YOUNG GIRL
Sherona?
... then back down at her tray.

JACKIE
Go ahead, start eating.
Sheronda starts eating, head down, hunching close to the
tray.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Would it bother you if I smoked?
Without raising her head, she shakes it from side to
side.
Jackie takes out a pack of Davidoffs and lights one up
with her yellow Bic. As she does this she observes
Sheronda eating.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Sheronda, can I ask you a question?
Are you and Ordell married?
Without raising her head.

SHERONDA
He say we like the same thing as
married.

JACKIE
Do you live together?
Sheronda hesitates, then says without raising her head.

SHERONDA
Most of the times.

JACKIE
Not every day?
Sheronda looks up at her...

SHERONDA
Sometimes every day, for a while.

JACKIE
Then you don't see him for a few
days?
... She looks back down.

SHERONDA
Yes'm.

JACKIE
You know what's in the bag you're
taking?

SHERONDA
He say is a surprise.

JACKIE
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking
to you.
Jackie picks up Sheronda's bag and leaves.

INT. DEL AMO MALL - BUSTA CAP - DAY
Max drinking his cafe mocha sans whipped cream, watches
Jackie leave the Young Girl and with Broadway bag in
hand, walk out of the food court.
Max watches her walk down the mall when two young men in
sport coats, jeans, and cowboy boots step out of a B.
Dalton bookstore, stop her and begin talking. Knowing
they must be Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them
take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They
talk for a minute - it would seem about nothing too
serious. Jackie nods her head, listens to the two cops,
nods her head again, and then walks off.
As he watches her walk away from the cops...

FLASH ON:

JACKIE AND MAX ON PHONE

JACKIE
You said it yourself. Ray wants
Ordell, he don't give a shit about
the money. Money won't convict him,
guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in
their lap, they take it. If they know
they got it, they'll look for it...
but if they don't...

BACK TO MAX AT MALL
Max watches the two cops turn their attention to the
young girl eating in the food court.
Max watches her, too. The Young Girl continues to work
her way through her Mexican food, when she turns her head
to an OLDER BLACK WOMAN sitting at the next table. The
older woman says something, and the younger woman hands
her the ashtray Jackie was using.
Max watches the Young Girl finish her food and get up
from the table. She stoops down to get the Broadway
shopping bag and walks out of the food court.
Max watches Nicolet and Dargus let the Young Girl get a
little ahead, then follow after her. They're gone.
Max turns back on the older woman all alone.
She finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up,
carrying - how about that? - A Broadway shopping bag. The
woman heads out of the mall.
Max follows her.
The older woman walks past us. She heads straight for the
exit.

EXT. DEL AMO MALL - PARKING LOT - DAY
Max follows the woman outside.
She walks down a line of cars, then gets in a big, tan
Mercury sedan. She drives of...
... but not before Max writes down her license plate
number.

FLASH ON:

MAX AND JACKIE ON PHONE

MAX
You're rationalizing.

JACKIE
That's what you do to go through with
the shit you start. You rationalize.
I can do this, Max, I know I can. But
I can't do it without you.

INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - DAY
Max climbs into his Seville, starts her up, and drives
out of the parking lot.

CLOSEUP MAX
Driving down the street, lost in thought.

MAX
(to himself)
It could work... If she handles the
cops right, I could work...
He hits 'play' on the dash CD player. The Delfonics fill
the cab of the Caddy.

CUT TO:

BLACK
A garage door is lifted open, revealing Ordell and Louis.

EXT. STORAGE FACLITY - DAY
Ordell and Louis are at Mr. Robbie's storage facility. A
VAN is backed up nect to the opening. The facility is
pitch black. Ordell ahs a big flashlight in his hand.

ORDELL
Check this out.
He turns on the flashlight.
He shines the beam into darkness. We see the facility is
filled to the gills with machine guns, shotguns, uzis, a
rocket launcher, and handguns of many types.

LOUIS
How much is there?

ORDELL
Over half-million dollars worth of
merchandise.
Ordell opens the back doors of the van. They start
unloading machine guns and boxes of ammo.

LOUIS
Can I ask you about Melanie?

ORDELL
Sure.

LOUIS
What's your relationship?

ORDELL
She one of the women I got set up. I
got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent
Simone a small house in Compton, and
about four blocks away I got me this
nineteen-year-old country girl named
Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a
bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot,
country as a chicken coop. Took her
to my house in Compton, told her it
was Hollywood.

LOUIS
She believed you?

ORDELL
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's
ever been, anyway.
They both laugh together.

LOUIS
Do you trust Melanie?
Ordell stops unloading.

ORDELL
If this is about you fucked Melanie,
I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool.
I leave you alone with a bitch like
Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that
twenty minutes after I'm out the
door. So say "thank you" and I'll
tell you, "you're welcome."

LOUIS
That's not what I meant when I asked
did you trust her.
Ordell looks at him.

ORDELL
She tryin' to work your ass against
me, ain't she?

LOUIS
Yep.

ORDELL
You didn't even hafta say it. I know
the woman.

LOUIS
Well, why the fuck keep her around?

ORDELL
(smiling)
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal.
She can't do me no harm. Fact she
think she can play you against me
shows how little she knows. You could
teach that bitch for days how it is
'tween me an you, she never
understand a damn word.

LOUIS
Why do you let someone know your
business you can't trust?

ORDELL
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.

LOUIS
What does that mean?

ORDELL
You can't trust Melanie. But you can
always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
Louis starts unloading.

LOUIS
I still don't understand why you keep
her around.

ORDELL
I told you, man.
(smiling)
She my fine little surfer gal.

EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
EXTREME CLOSEUP - Jackie's finger presses a small black
button next to the
handwritten name, "M. RALSTON."

EXTREME CLOSEUP SPEAKER BOX

MELANIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
(coming out of it)
What?

JACKIE
Bends down to talk in the speaker.

JACKIE
It's Jackie.

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY
Jackie walks down the hallway and finds the door.
She rings the doorbell.
The door opens, she sees Melanie (for the first time) on
the other side. Melanie, dressed in a t-shirt, cut offs,
doesn't say a word - just turns around and walks away.
Once Melanie leaves, she sees Ordell standing inside the
apartment, screwdriver in hand, yelling after Melanie;

ORDEL
... Now she's gonna pout...
He turns his attention to Jackie.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Hey, Jackie, c'mon in.
Jackie steps inside.
She sees Louis (for the first time) sitting on the couch.
Ordell says to Louis, but loud enough for Melanie in the
other room to hear;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
She gonna hafta find her sandals...
find her bag... find her
sunglasses... take twenty damn
minutes get her ass out the door.
(to Jackie)
Jackie - his is Louis, Louis -
Jackie. And the chick stompin' around
in the other room is Melanie.
Melanie comes out of the bedroom with her sunglasses,
sandals, bag strung across her shoulders and her keys in
her hand. She makes a bee-line towards the door without
saying nothin' to nobody.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
You have a nice time, hear?
The door SLAMS behind her.
Ordell looks to Jackie, raises his screwdriver and says;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Drink?

JACKIE
I need to talk to you alone.

EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY
Ordell and Jackie on the balcony.

JACKIE
I don't want no more fuckin'
surprises. We do this the way I laid
it out, or we don't do it at all.

ORDELL
What the hell you talkin' bout?

JACKIE
Sheronda passin' the money onto
someone else, that's what the hell
I'm talkin' 'bout.

ORDELL
How do you know she did that?

JACKIE
I was there, I saw her do it.

ORDELL
Well, you weren't supposed to be
there.

JACKIE
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I
figured you'd try an' pull some shit
like this.

ORDELL
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'
no shit. It's my money, I can do
whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.

JACKIE
Not when it's my ass on the line you
don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Ordell tries to stop the hostile back and forth.

ORDELL
Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It
ain't no big thing. The woman you saw
was my friend, Simone. She's the one
gonna be receiving the money, so I
just wanted her to see how it works.
She'll be here any minute. Nice
woman, you'll like her.
Ordell opens the sliding glass and says to Louis in the
living room;

ORDELL
Louis, call Simone and tell her to
get her tail over here. We're waitin'
on her ass.
Louis gets up to make the call.
Ordell turns back to Jackie and smiles, holding up his
screwdriver.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I
can't tempt you?

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
Ordell and Jackie sit on stools around the kitchen
counter/bar. Louis sits with them on the phone, silent.

JACKIE
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the
airport and mark the bills.

ORDELL
Man, I don't like that part.

JACKIE
It washes off. I tell them we're
doing it the same way as before.
They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the
idea of leaving her for a fall.

ORDELL
She won't have no problems 'cause she
don't know nothin'.

JACKIE
Are you sure she don' know about the
money?

ORDELL
She don't know shit about the money.

JACKIE
What does she think she's gettin?

ORDELL
I told her this is a game us rich
folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a
scavenger hunt. She didn't know what
that was neither.
(to Louis)
No answer?
Louis shakes his head.

LOUIS
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
Hang it up, she's on her way. You
gotta listen to this. This involves
you.
Louis hangs up the phone and joins the debriefing.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
No, you gonna give her a
Robinson's/May bag this time?

JACKIE
Right, the one Simone gives me.
Simone and I'll make the switch at
Robinson's/May. She knows what I look
like?

ORDELL
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone
goes to the dress department with her
Robinson's/May bag.

JACKIE
Designer clothes.

ORDELL
She waits for you to go in the place
where you try things on.

JACKIE
The fitting room. There's a sign over
the door.

LOUIS
Why we doin' I there?

JACKIE
I have a hunch they'll be watchin'
me. We can't risk switching bags out
in the open or even in the dining
area. That's why it has to be a
woman, 'cause we do the switch in the
fitting room.

ORDELL
So you come out with her
Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda.
Simone peeks out, waits for my man
Louis here to give her a signal
nobody's watchin'. She leaves the
store, gets in her car - mission
accomplished.

JACKIE
Where you gonna be during all this?

ORDELL
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar
In downtown L.A. till my man over
here calls me and gives me the O.K.
sign.
Jackie's pager goes off. She looks at it.

JACKIE
I gotta go.

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY
Ordell walks Jackie to the elevator.

ORDELL
Who's paging you?

JACKIE
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

ORDELL
That works on my nerves, you bein' so
buddy-buddy with him.

JACKIE
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now
once I deliver I'll have to trust
you.

ORDELL
Well, I've been trusting you all this
time, haven't I? We agreed on ten
percent of what you bring in and
that's what you gonna get.
They reach the elevator. She presses the button.

JACKIE
And a hundred thousand if I go to
jail.

ORDELL
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't
gonna screw you. You haven't told me
where I put it for you.
The elevator arrives. Jackie steps in.

JACKIE
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max
Cherry. He'll take care of it.

ORDELL
Max Cherry? You and him friends now?
You tell him about this shit?

JACKIE
He won't know where the money came
from. Only that it's money.
... the elevator shuts... As it shuts Ordell yells;...

ORDELL
Don't you know all them bail bondsmen
are crooks...
... the door shuts.

CLOSEUP ORDELL
He doesn't like the last piece of new information.

EXT. THE STRAND - DAY
The Strand is the hip surfer street in downtown Hermosa
Beach. Jackie leaves the apartment building. She walks to
her car when she spots a funky little beach bar called,
"Sally Leroy's."

INT. SALLY LEROY'S - DAY
Sally Leroy's is a beach bar with surfboards, different
beer signs, and pictures of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis
Presley, James Dean, Ann Margaret, and surfers riding
monster waves all over the place.
The JUKEBOX plays a loud seventies rock number.

BEGINNING OF SHOT
The camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking
into the place and going up to the bar...
A female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid
workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie.

JACKIE
Do you have a phone?

WANDA
Yeah, it's in the back.

JACKIE
Thanks.
... We follow with her to the back of the bar... the
MUSIC is LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat
older GUY wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache
like a walrus. Jackie waits for him to finish his call...
As she waits, the CAMERA MOVES BACK... until a blonde
head of hair comes into the f.g....
The CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking
on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching
Jackie. She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME.

END OF SHOT
Jackie hears behind her;

MELANIE (O.S.)
Hey!
Jackie turns and sees Melanie holding a beer, standing
behind her.

JACKIE
Oh, hi.

MELANIE
Buy ya a beer?

JACKIE
I'm waiting for the phone.

MELANIE
Good luck. That guy's been in there
since I got here.

JACKIE
Well, I guess I better look for
another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
Jackie turns to leave.

MELANIE
I know what you and Ordell got goin'.
You sit down and have a beer with me.
I'll tell you a secret.
Jackie looks at her a moment.

JACKIE
Sure.

MELANIE
Great...
(calling to the
bartender)
... Wanda!
Wanda approaches.

WANDA
What?

MELANIE
This lady is thirsty.

WANDA
What do you want?

MELANIE
What's on tap?

WANDA
Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and
Killian's Red.

JACKIE
Killian's.

MELANIE
Better get me another Sam's.
(to Jackie)
Join me in a Jaeger shot?

JACKIE
Uh-uh.

MELANIE
Gimme one anyway.

WANDA
You got it.
Wanda goes away. Jackie and Melanie sit at the bar. The
MUSIC is LOUD, and they have to talk over it. Melanie
moves her head to it during the conversation.

JACKIE
How long you been with Ordell?

MELANIE
This time? Almost a year. I've known
him forever.

JACKIE
What were you two fighting about?

MELANIE
He told me to go outside.
(imitating Ordell's
voice)
"You may leave us now." It's all part
of his pathetic attempt to be "the
man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Jackie nods "yes."

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about
Ordell.

JACKIE
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
Melanie makes a face to show pain.

MELANIE
Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about
that. I hope they don't come down on
you on my account. Ordell shoulda
told you it was in your bag.
Wanda brings the drinks.

WANDA
Seven dollars.
Melanie digs in her purse for the money.

JACKIE
He said he didn't know about it.

MELANIE
(digging in her purse)
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess
you have to trust him.
(pulls out a ten)
I'd have second thoughts on that, but
then I know 'em.
Melanie takes her Jaeger shot, lets it go down, then
continues.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
He killed a guy who works for him the
other day.

JACKIE
Beaumont Livingston?

MELANIE
You already knew that?

JACKIE
Kinda.

MELANIE
So tell me. Having all that money in
your flight bag - Is it tempting?
Jackie nods 'yes', as she sips her beer.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me to
carry in ten thousand dollars, that
would be the last motherfuckin' time
he saw me. The next trip you're gonna
have over half-a-million. If you
thought of cutting Ordell out, I sure
as hell wouldn't blame you.
Jackie smiles.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
You think I'm kidding?

JACKIE
Dreaming.

MELANIE
You know how easy it would be? He
won't be anywhere near that mall.
Pull one more switch, up front.
That's it. half-a-million dollars.
Need help?

JACKIE
(smiling)
Keep it between us girls?

MELANIE
What's that fucker ever done for us?

JACKIE
(getting off the
barstool)
I don't think so, but thanks for the
beer.
Jackie leaves.

CLOSEUP MELANIE
Watches her go.

MELANIE
(softly under her breath)
Chicken shit.

INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT
Jackie and Nicolet sit at a steakhouse eating a steak
dinner. Nicolet drinks beer, Jackie drinks white wine.

JACKIE
Ordell has a white guy working for
him named Louis.

NICOLET
You two meet?

JACKIE
This afternoon before I came here. He
was with Ordell at an apartment in
Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he
lives there, but I can find out.

NICOLET
You talk to him?

JACKIE
Not really.

NICOLET
His full name is Louis Gara. He just
got out from serving four years in
Susanville.

JACKIE
What for?

NICOLET
Bank robbery? Do you know what he
does for Ordell?

JACKIE
I imagine shit needs to be done.

NICOLET
We've been following Mr. Gara, and
he's definitely working for Ordell.

FLASH ON:

NICOLET AND DARGUS
In a car, parked, on surveillance.

COPS POV
Louis with the van, at the storage facility.

NICOLET (V.O.)
They served two years together almost
twenty years ago in Soledad. But he
doesn't live in Hermosa Beach.
Ordell's got him staying at a house
in.

MUG SHOT SIMONE
The older woman in the mall.

NICOLET (V.O.)
... Compton with a fifty-six-year-
old petty thief - woman named Simone
Hawkins.

BACK TO BAR

NICOLET
Ever meet her, or they talk about
her?

JACKIE
Not yet.

NICOLET
Who's the other one?

JACKIE
White girl named Melanie Ralston.
Another girlfriend of Ordell's.

NICOLET
What's her story?

JACKIE
It was her coke I got busted with.
She knows everything, but she's not
part of it, and she's pissed cause
she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't
even let her stay at the meeting. She
tried to talk me into ripping off
Ordell.

NICOLET
And splittin' with her?

JACKIE
I'm sure that was the idea.

NICOLET
What did you say?

JACKIE
I smiled and walked away. She also
told me Ordell killed Beaumont.

NICOLET
She told you that?

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

NICOLET
Was she there?

JACKIE
She didn't say.

NICOLET
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

NICOLET
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd
like to have a word with. So
everything's set for tomorrow?

JACKIE
Right. Everything's the same, except
one change...

INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking
white wine.
Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,
Davidoff in the other, going over the details of
tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.
There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After
all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million
dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make
all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk
what she wants them to think.
As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
will either fail or succeed. But don't take this
difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is
not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not
afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before
an all-important competition.

JACKIE
I told them Ordell's changed the
amount he's bringing in.

MAX
Do you think they bought it?

JACKIE
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking
Ordell's real nervous. They love
thinking he's scared of them.

MAX
You know, a good cop won't let you
know he knows you're fulla shit.

JACKIE
All he needed was a reasonable
explanation.

DISSOLVE TO:

BACK TO JACKIE WITH NICOLET

MEDIUM JACKIE

JACKIE
Right. Everything's the same except
one change. Ordell thinks it's just
too hot right now to bring in all his
money. He knows you're watching him,
and he's paranoid. He's keeping his
stash where it is, but he wants to
bring in fifty thousand for bail in
case he needs it.

CUT TO:

BACK TO JACKIE AND MAX

MAX
It'll be more than that.

JACKIE
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.

MAX
But you still have to show him the
money at the airport.

JACKIE
Well, you know I'm not going to show
him the whole amount. He'll see fifty
thousand.

MAX
Where's the rest of it?

JACKIE
In the bag underneath.

MAX
What if he checks it?

JACKIE
He won't - I mean, he didn't the last
time. He'll be expecting fifty
thousand and there it is - on top.

MAX
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.

JACKIE
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr.
Walker put the money in, and I didn't
know nothing about it. Like the coke.

MAX
Then you're out and you get nothing.

JACKIE
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I
tried.

MAX
You're gonna have surveillance all
over you.

JACKIE
That's why you don't make a move till
I come out of the fitting room.

MAX
In a dress.

JACKIE
Well, a suit. There's one I had my
eye on.
The phone rings.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Excuse me.

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell on the phone

ORDELL
It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change
in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout
- everything's the same - except for
one change. That bitch you saw in the
mall, Simone. She wasn't here today,
cause she split on me.
(pause)
Me an Louis went over to her place
,she's gone. She's gone and all her
shit's gone and so's my ten thousand
dollars.
(pause)
It ain't nothin' to worry about,
girl. Everything's just like we
discussed. Except when you do the
switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna
be Melanie.
Melanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat.
Louis sits at the other end of the couch. They're
watching "Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" on TV.

ON TV
Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're
pursued by police cars.
They can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at
Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare
foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and
gives her a look that says: "I'm not on your side, bitch.
So knock it of."
Melanie sees this and takes her foot away.
Louis turns back to the television.

CLOSEUP MELANIE
Looks at Louis for a moment, then sighs, saying under her
breath;

MELANIE
Chicken shit.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"MONEY EXCHANGE 550,000"

FADE UP:

A GRAPHIC MAP
With Mexico and California on it. On the Mexico side we
see "CABO SAN LUCAS" with a big circle around it. On the
California side we see "LAX" in a similar circle. The
tiny figure of a black AIRPLANE appears in the Cabo
circle. With appropriate SOUND EFFECTS it takes off from
Cabo, flying towards LAX, leaving a dotted line behind
it. The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of the little black
airplane.

CUT TO:

CLOSEUP JACKIE
Looking down...

INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - DAY
Rearranging her bag. The five hundred thousand inside
takes up half the space. She tucks lingerie around the
edges, covers the money with blouses, shoes, and skirts
and ties I all down tight. Then places a fat envelope
with fifty thousand right on top.

INT. CABIN - AIRPLANE - DAY
Jackie steps out of the bathroom, walks down the aisle,
and is stopped by a PASSENGER.

PASSENGER
Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink
and you spend half the fuckin' flight
in the can. Soon as we land I'm
making a formal complaint.

JACKIE
Why, because I called you an asshole.

PASSENGER
You didn't call me that.

JACKIE
I didn't? Oh, well, you're an
asshole.

INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME: 3:00"
Jackie steps into the LAX parking structure, pulling her
bag on wheels behind her.
Waiting for her is Ray Nicolet.

NICOLET
We have to stop meeting like this.
They fall into step towards her car.

JACKIE
You said that the last time.

NICOLET
Well, it's true, isn't it? After his
is buttoned up we could meet
someplace else. What do you think?

JACKIE
We could, if I'm not in jail.

NICOLET
Oh, that's taken care of. I called
the State Attorney's Office. You were
no-filed this morning in Circuit
Court.

CLOSEUP JACKIE
This information stops Jackie in her tracks.

JACKIE
Are you saying I'm off the hook?

JACKIE'S POV
Nicolet, who kept walking when Jackie stopped, looks back
at Jackie.

NICOLET
Free as a bird. I still expect you to
finish the job, though. How much do
you have this time?
Jackie starts walking again

JACKIE
Fifty thousand, like I said. He's
pretty sure he's gonna need it for
bail.

INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY
Jackie and Nicolet in the parked car. Ray has the flight
bag in his lap.
He unzips it.
He sees the clothes with the envelope on top.
Jackie watches all of this.

NICOLET
That's fifty thousand, huh? It
doesn't look like that much.

JACKIE
I was told ten thousand in each pack.

NICOLET
You didn't count it?

JACKIE
I never have. It's not my money.
He puts the envelope back in the bag and feels through
the folds of a skirt.

NICOLET
He might have slipped some coke in
here. Did you check?
Jackie, cool.

JACKIE
Mr. Walker promised he'd never do
that again.
Nicolet's fingers move to a pair of black heels wedged
into the side... they touch the shoes... then move over
to the envelope, opens the clasp and takes out five
rubber-banded bond packets of loot.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Ever been tempted?

NICOLET
What? To put one of these in my
pocket?

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

NICOLET
If I did, I'd have to give you one,
wouldn't I? Or we could take what we
want. No one knows how much there is
except us, right?

JACKIE
Yes. All those things are true.

NICOLET
After all, it don't belong to nobody,
right?

JACKIE
That would be one point of view.

NICOLET
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view
that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it
evidence, it belongs to us. You are
now officially out of trouble. Don't
do nothing stupid, now.

JACKIE
How can I do anything if I'm being
watched every second?

NICOLET
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me
the trouble of pointing it out to
you.
(holding up the money)
Put this in your shopping bag. It's
what I expect to find when I look in
Sheronda's. Comprende?

JACKIE
Si.

INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY

there?!

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
Louis stands in the empty living room, talking to Ordell
on the phone. Kate Bush plays in the b.g.

LOUIS
I was ready to leave ten minutes ago.
Ordell snaps at Louis, not so harsh Louis is forced to
retaliate, but enough to express his loss of patience.

ORDELL
Well, you the one in motherfuckin'
charge.

LOUIS
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'

ORDELL
Go in there, snatch her by the hair,
and drag her big ass out. This is my
goddam money we're talking about. Get
your ass out the door.
He hangs up on Louis.
Louis, pissed at being hung up on and talked to like
that, hangs up the phone and turns his frustration where
it rightly belongs - Melanie.
Louis stomps towards the bedroom where the music's
playing.

LOUIS
We're leaving now!

MELANIE (O.S.)
All right already.

MONTAGE
We see a montage of the individual characters in route to
the mall.

Boulevard to the mall. He plays hid Delfonics CD.

LOUIS AND MELANIE
In Melanie's Toyota drive towards the mall. Melanie
drives singing along with Kate Bush on her car stereo.

EXT. DEL AMO MALL PARKING LOT - DAY
Jackie's car pulls up to a lined parking space in the
parking lot.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME 3:52"
Jackie gets out of the Honda with her flight bag. She
goes to her hatchback, takes a Robinson's/May bag, lines
the first half of the bag with old paperbacks.
Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the
fifty-thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten
thousand, and puts it in her pocket. She lines the
envelope with forty thousand across the books, then fills
the rest of the bag with beach towels.
Then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder,
carrying the Robinson's/May bag and with all the
confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into
the ring, she strides toward the hugs mall.

INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
Jackie enters the mall. She looks at the people buzzing
around. Any one of them could be surveillance.
She calmly walks down the mall, then turns into the
Roinson's/May store.

INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY
Jackie, in her Cabo Air uniform, walks up to a young
Asian saleswoman named Amy in the Robinson's/May designer
clothing area.
The saleswoman smiles when she sees Jackie.

AMY
Can I help you?

JACKIE
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye
on.
Jackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real
sharp, badass, black suit with a white blouse.

AMY
Oh, my God. You look so cool.
Jackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out.

JACKIE
This looks pretty good on me.

AMY
Are you kidding, it looks great. You
wear this to a business meeting,
you're the badass in the room. But
you can go out dancing in this too.
It's a total power suit.
Jackie studies her reflection.

JACKIE
I think I'm gonna just get this for
today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would
you mind ringing this up while I
change out of it?

AMY
Not a problem.

JACKIE
Thanks.
Jackie walks into the fitting room.

INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY
She walks down the fitting room hallway with changing
cubicles on her right, enters the last one.
She closes the door and sits down on the bench in between
her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's/May bag.
A full-length mirror is straight I front of her. She
looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall
next to her.
Melanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall.

MEALNIE (O.S.)
Jackie?

JACKIE
Hi, Melanie.

MELANIE (O.S.)
Are you getting that black suit?

JACKIE
Yeah, do you like it?

MELANIE (O.S.)
It looks good on you.

JACKIE
Do you got something for me?

MELANIE (O.S.)
You betcha.
A Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels,
comes sliding underneath the stall.
Jackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with
books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars.
She takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars
and lies it on top of the bag.
As she does all this Melanie continues talking.

MELANIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
We coulda worked this. You know that,
dontcha? You would've made out a lot
better than you're going to, believe
me.
Jackie slides the Robinson's/May bag with money under the
stall.
Melanie sees the money on top and stops talking.

JACKIE
I put a little cherry on top. You're
right. What the hell he ever do for
us?

MELANIE (O.S.)
(quietly)
Thanks.

JACKIE
Now be careful with that bag. You
don't want it ripping open on you in
the middle of the store.
We hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving.
Jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out
of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She
sticks her uniform in the flight bag.
Then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money.
She grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the
Robinson's/May bag filled with half of a million dollars.

INT. DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY
Jackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch
frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales
counter where Amy waits for her.

JACKIE
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in
the suit - get out of that damn
uniform.

AMY
Oh, that's not a problem.
As Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction
the CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more
RAPIDLY each go-around. They complete the transaction and
as Jackie starts to leave, she stops and says to Amy;

JACKIE
Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
there. Looks like beach towels.
She leaves. We follow her...

INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
... Jackie walks out of Robinson's/May hurriedly into the
main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with
Jackie is completely gone.
She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction
to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to
twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something
she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of
tears.
As the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams;

JACKIE
Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She
took the money.
The CAMERA stops twirling.
Nicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come
running out of a store towards Jackie. As they reach her,
a frantic Jackie yells;

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Melanie burst in the dressing room
and took the money!

CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
Louis and Melanie pull up to a lined parking space in
Melanie's Toyota.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME: 4:12"
Louis is the first out of the car.

LOUIS
Come on, goddammit, we're late!

INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
We STEDICAM in front of them, Louis the rapid pacesetter,
pulling Melanie behind him by the hand. Melanie carries
the Robinson's/May switch bag.

MELANIE
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.

LOUIS
We shoulda been there already and we
woulda been if it hadn't been for
your fuckin' around!
They go inside Robinson's/May...

INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
... We STEDICAM into Robison's/May with them. We lose
them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins,
but end up landing on Jackie in her black suit, looking
in a mirror and talking to Amy on the Designer Clothes
floor.

AM
... You wear this to a business
meeting, you're the badass in the
room...
We PAN away and find Louis and Melanie by a dress rack,
watching Jackie.

MELANIE
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm
gonna go over and look at this Michi
Moon display.

LOUIS
Just stay right fuckin' here, all
right?

MELANIE
Are you sweating?
Louis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches
dampness.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Job a little too much for you?
Louis shoots Melanie a hard convict look.
Melanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of
a natural-born smart ass to change.

MELANIE
I'll be over here. You're too
conspicuous.
Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going
inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards
him.
He watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in
time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.

LOUIS
(under his breath)
Goddammit, not till I tell ya.
He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too
much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees
something that stops him cold.

MAX CHERRY
Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the
fitting room.
He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'
Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis
staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
to do what he was doing.
He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
there are doing customer stuff.
Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag
and head down a different aisle.
He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
fight is said tense and low.

LOUIS
What are you doin'?

MELANIE
I'm getting out of here. What do you
think?

LOUIS
Lemme have the bag.

MELANIE
Fuck you. I can carry it.
She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
and pulls her around.

LOUIS
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,

MELANIE
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the
fuckin' bag?

LOUIS
Gimme that bag before I knock you out
and take it.
Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only
that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of
the bag.

MELANIE
Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's
wrong with you?
He takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of
them.

LOUIS
I'm carrying it.

MELANIE
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
pill, for christ sake.
Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely
through gritted teeth;

LOUIS
Fuck you with your chill pill.
In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;

MELANIE
Remember where we came in?
Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
(like a teacher on Romper
Room)
Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
in through Bullocks. I know where it
is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?
Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie
smirk, follows behind.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
Melanie follows close behind.
We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
see he has a searching look on his face.

MELANIE
You have no idea where you parked, do
you?
Louis doesn't answer.
Melanie laughs.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Jesus, but if you two aren't the
biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
life... How did you ever rob a bank?
When you robbed banks, did you have
to look for your car then too? No
wonder you went to jail.
Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
up.
But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?

LOUIS
Yeah, down the end.

MELANIE
You sure?
They walk it; it's not it.
Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
next one.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Is it this aisle or the next one
over?

LOUIS
This one.

MELANIE
You sure?
In between two cars, Louis spins on her.

LOUIS
Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
telling you, keep your mouth shut.
Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;

LOUIS
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
word.

MELANIE
Okay, Lou-is.
That did it!
Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
her... BAM... in the belly.
She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
HIM. He looks around, then yells out;

LOUIS
See, just where I fuckin' said it
was!
He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
and yells through the passenger window;

LOUIS
Hey, look. I found it!
He drives away.

CUT TO:

EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
in the parking lot.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME: 4:04"
Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
Del Amo Mall.

INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
Robinson's/May store.
He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward
the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry
counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display
case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.

SALESGIRL
Can I show you something?

MAX
Not right now. I'm just killing time
waiting for my wife. But thanks,
anyway.

SALESGIRL
Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
don't be shy.

MAX
Thanks, I won't.
She goes off.
He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.

AMY
Oh, my God. You look so cool.
Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.
Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under
his breath;

MAX (CONT'D)
(low)
And away we go.
Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives
her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles
and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."
Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer
Clothes.
He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses
on a rack.
He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.
He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns
the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on
his before he can see a reaction.
Max continues his fake browsing.
He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.
She and Louis disappear.
He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to
Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting
agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with
cash, then leaves stopping to say;

JACKIE
Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
there. Looks like beach towels.
She's gone.
Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.
It's Max's turn.
As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
he says to himself;

MAX
Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
years dealing with people who take
incredible risks. You walk over to
that counter, you're gonna find out
what it's like.
Max takes a few moments...
... then walks over to Amy.

MAX
Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
left a bag of beach towels in the
fitting room?

AMY
Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
think they're in the last stall.

MAX
Thanks.
Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.
He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the
towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the
Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;

MAX
Got 'em, thanks.

AMY
Sure thing.
Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
parking lot.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
He made it. It worked.
Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
his half-a-million bucks and drives away.

INT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUS - DAY
Ordell sits at the bar in Sam's drinking a screwdriver
and watching a stripper strip.

BARTENDER
There a Ordell here?

ORDELL
That's me.
The bartender hands him the phone.

BARTENDER
Don't talks all day.
Ordell takes the receiver.

INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY
A stressed Louis drives the Toyota, calling Ordell on
Ordell's tiny cellular.

LOUIS
It's Louis.

ORDELL
(now into phone)
Did you get it?

LOUIS
I got it. Listen, there's something
else I have to tell you.

ORDELL
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's.
You count the money?

LOUIS
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's
still in the shopping bag.

ORDELL
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.
(pause)
Louis.

LOUIS
That's what I got to talk to you
about. You see, Melanie was giving me
a hard time -

ORDELL
- Not now, pick me up.
Louis hears the phone disconnect.

EXT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUR - DAY
The Toyota pulls up to the back of the bar. Ordell hops
in, the car takes off.

INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY
Oredell in the passenger seat, bends over to the
backseat, grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his
lap. He looks like a kid at Christmas.

ORDELL
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where
they got all them car dealerships.
We're gonna leave this heap in a
parking lot and get one the cops
don't know about.
(pause)
Hey, where's Melanie?

LOUIS
That's what I gotta tell you. She
bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
carry the bag. Started running her
fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember
right away when we came out where the
car was parked, so she got on me
about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,
is it that one?" She was totally
fuckin' with my nerves.

ORDELL
So what, you left her there.

LOUIS
I shot her.
Ordell just looks at him.

LOUIS (CONT'D)
I expect she's dead.
Ordell still doesn't say anything... then says;

ORDELL
You shot Melanie?

LOUIS
Twice. In the parking lot.

ORDELL
Couldn't talk to her?

LOUIS
You know how she is.

ORDELL
You couldn't just hit her?

LOUIS
Maybe... but at that moment... I
dunno...

ORDELL
You shot her twice?

LOUIS
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
So you're sure she's dead.

LOUIS
Pretty sure.

ORDELL
Where did you shoot her?

LOUIS
In the chest and stomach.

ORDELL
Well, if you had to do it, you had to
do it. What we don't want is that
bitch surviving on us. Anybody but
that woman.
Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on
top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just
looks inside the bag for the longest time.
Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
(quiet)
Louis?

LOUIS
(not looking at him)
What?

ORDELL
Where's the rest of it?

LOUIS
(looking at him)
How much it there?

ORDELL
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.

LOUIS
You said five hundred and fifty!

ORDELL
(calm)
So you light, ain't you. You light
about a half-a-million.

LOUIS
Look, that's the bag she came out
with. She never even put her hand in
it, and neither did I.

ORDELL
Came outta where?

LOUIS
The fitting room. It went down
exactly the way it was supposed to.

ORDELL
How long was she in there?

LOUIS
Maybe a minute. She came right out.

ORDELL
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?

LOUIS
Look, I swear to fucking god, she
came out with that bag and I took it
from her.

ORDELL
Then what?

LOUIS
We went to the parking lot.

ORDELL
Where you shot her.

LOUIS
That's right.

ORDELL
You sure she ain't somewhere with a
half-a-million dollars I worked my
ass off to earn?
Louis looks at Ordell;

LOUIS
(quietly)
Fuck you for asking me that.

ORDELL
Pull the car over.
Louis pulls it over, and stops on Ninth.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
What'd you shoot her with?

LOUIS
It's in there.
Ordell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta. He
smells the end of the barrel. He releases the magazine.

LOUIS (CONT'D)
What's that gonna tell you" If I was
really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken
two out, wouldn't I? I thought you
trusted me.
Ordell looks at him. Louis didn't burn him.

CLOSEUP ORDELL
He thinks.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSEUP JACKIE
Holding a bunch of money, looking into the camera, and
saying with a smile;

JACKIE
Gotcha, nigga.

DISSOLVE BACK

TO:

CLOSEUP ORDELL
Jackie's gonna die. He slaps the magazine back into the
Beretta.

ORDELL
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.

LOUIS
If she's got it, why didn't she take
it all?

ORDELL
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out,
I'll ask her.

LOUIS
Maybe the Feds got it.

ORDELL
If there were nothin; in here but
towels, maybe she didn't get a chance
to take it from her suitcase and
A.T.F. got it. But, she put these
fuckin' books in here to trick our
ass.

LOUIS
That's why I never checked it. The
bag felt right.

ORDELL
Then she throws forty thousand in
here, to rub the shit in my face,
know what I'm saying? She wants me to
know she ripped me off.

LOUIS
I don't know. Either she has it or
the Feds.

ORDELL
Or...
(pause)
... she gave it to somebody else
first, before Melanie went in the
dressing room.
It gets real quiet in the car, as Louis remembers
something.

LOUIS
Jesus Christ.

ORDELL
What?

LOUIS
You know who I saw in the dress
department?

ORDELL
Tell me.

LOUIS
I didn't really think anything of it.
No - I did wonder what he was doing
there, but didn't think it had
anything to do with us. You know like
maybe he was there with his wife or
girlfriend.

ORDELL
You gonna tell me who it was?

LOUIS
Max Cherry.
Ordell has to look away from Louis, takes a beat, then
looks back.

ORDELL
You see Max Cherry in the dress
department. We're about to be handed
half-a-million dollars - Man, look at
me when I'm talking to you! And you
don't think nothing of him being
there!

LOUIS
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know
each other?

ORDELL
Hell, yes, they know each other. He
bonded her out of county.

LOUIS
How am I supposed to know that?

ORDELL
You know the motherfucker's a bail
bondsman, don't ya? You know every
last one of them motherfuckers is
crooked as hell?

LOUIS
Why should I think anything's weird,
if I don't know nothin' about them
knowing each other?

ORDELL
Man, I don't want to hear your
fuckin' excuses!
Louis gets mad.

LOUIS
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses,
I'm givin' you reasons.

ORDELL
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you
lost all the goddam money I got in
the world! Let me tell you the
reason, motherfucker! The reason is,
your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Louis turns into the hard convict on the yard, and tells
Ordell;

LOUIS
(hard)
You best back off.
We hear a BAM.
Louis jerks.
Ordell shot him.
Louis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open,
staring at Ordell.
Ordell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on
Louis' side, right under him arm, and shoots him again.
This time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window.
He slumps over - his life gone.
Ordell looks at him.

ORDELL
What the fuck happened to you, man?
Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.
Ordell takes the bag and gets out of the car, leaving
Louis' dead body there.

DISSOLVE TO:

MEDIUM NICOLET

NICOLET
You didn't tell me you were gonna do
some shopping.

INT. NICOLET'S OFFICE (A.T.F. HEADQUARTERS) - DAY
Jackie, still dressed in her cool black suit, sits in a
chair in Nicolet's office. Davidoff between the fingers
of one hand, she holds a small, white styrofoam cup of
coffee in he other.
Ray stands.

JACKIE
I thought I did.

NICOLET
You didn't. I would think with all
this on your mind, you'd wait till
after.

JACKIE
I got there early. I've had my eye on
this suit - Wait, let's start over. I
got there early. The idea was to try
on the suit, see if I liked it. If I
did, get them to wrap it up, and
change back into my uniform. That's
what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.
Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag
with fifty thousand, and go home.

NICOLET
But you didn't do that.

JACKIE
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I
swear, Melanie came in and grabbed
it.
(pause)
And someone killed her for it.
Nicolet looks at Jackie for a moment.

NICOLET
Where's the bag she gave you?

JACKIE
She didn't give me one. I told you
before, Melanie wasn't part of the
plan. Ordell must of told her to do
it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
bag, and takes off. What am I
supposed to do, go after her? I'm in
my fucking underwear. I had to get
dressed before I could do anything.
So I put this back on 'cause could
put this on faster than I could my
uniform.

NICOLET
You took the time to pay the
saleswoman.

JACKIE
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't
know what to do.

NICOLET
What did you do after that?

JACKIE
I went looking for you. I went
straight to the bookstore, 'cause
that's where you were last time, but
you weren't there. How the hell else
am I supposed to let anybody know
what happened? You didn't tell me how
to do that, did you? I knew I was
under surveillance, so when I
couldn't spot anybody, I started
yelling.

NICOLET
There was a guy with Melanie?

JACKIE
Not in the fitting room.

CUT TO:

A YOUNG WOMAN A.T.F SURVEILLANCE AGENT
Pretends to shop. She watches Louis grab Melanie.

NICOLET (V.O.)
We had our agent on you. She sees a
blonde come out of the fitting room
carrying a Robinson's/May bag and
tussle with a tough-looking white
guy. The white guy takes the shopping
bag and they go.

BACK TO OFFICE

NICOLET
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis
Gara?

JACKIE
I didn't see him. I was in my
underwear. If it was a white guy, it
was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?

NICOLET
It's possible. You're saying you
don't have any idea what happened to
that fifty thousand?

JACKIE
I have no idea.

NICOLET
You'd take a polygraph on it?

JACKIE
If it'll make you happy.

NICOLET
I sure hope you haven't done anything
dumb Jackie.
Dargus comes to the doorway...

DARGUS
(to Nicolet)
Can I have a word with you?

NICOLET
Sure.
They both leave, leaving Jackie all by herself in the
room, smoking.
They both come back in.
Nicolet continues, Dargus takes a seat in the corner
saying nothing.

NICOLET (CONT'D)
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him
dead in a car on Ninth. And we've
lost Ordell.

JACKIE
I thought you were watching him.

NICOLET
We were, and we lost him. He walked
into a strip bar sometime around
three thirty and never came out. The
bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
and-a-half from where Louis was found
dead. It looks like Louis's friend
shot him twice at point blank range.

JACKIE
So what happens now?

NICOLET
We pick up Ordell. We've got three
murders we can link him to. We have
the storage unit where he keeps his
guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search
warrant to go in and get him. And we
have you.

JACKIE
What about me?

NICOLET
What about you?

JACKIE
Do you think I took some of that
money?

NICOLET
I have no evidence of your taking
anything. You didn't pay for your
snazzy new suit with marked bills; I
was glad to see that. You've been
helping us out, you gave us Melanie
and Louis. Melanie had a packet of
marked bills stuffed in her shorts
when they found her, which goes a
long way backing up your story.
Jackie listens.

NICOLET (CONT'D)
I'll settle for Ordell with the
marked bills.

NICOLET
If you have something else going on
you haven't told me about, it's
between you and Ordell. All I gotta
say is, you better hope we find him
before he finds you.

DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSEUP ORDELL
On the phone.

ORDEL

Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my
friends are... Mr. Walker?

INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - DAY
Ordell turn to a glassy-eyed black female junkie nodding
on the couch named RAYNELLE. The filthy apartment we're
in belongs to her.

ORDELL
Can you believe that shit?
Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate
nigger. Do things for people and
that's how they treat you. Goddamn
girl, how can you live like this?
He dials another number.

RAYNELLE

Like what?

ORDELL
Girl, this shit is repugnant.

He's around.

ORDELL
Give me his home number.

WINSTON
I'll give you his beeper.

CUT TO:

A YOUNG BLACK COMEDIAN ON TV
Def Comedy Jam plays on TV, a black comedian does a nasty
stand-up routine.

INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
Ordell and Raynelle sit on the couch watching Def Comedy
Jam; neither one is laughing. Raynelle's too stoned.
Ordell's too tense. The phone rings, he jumps on it

ORDELL
Hello.

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
Max on the other end behind his desk. Winston sitting on
the edge of the desk listening.

MAX
I've been looking for you.
Ordell's up and off the couch pacing.

ORDELL
You know who this is?

MAX
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the
ten thousand you put up. Isn't that
why you called.
Ordell doesn't say anything.

MAX (CONT'D)
The bond collateral on Beaumont
Livingston you moved over to cover
Miss Brown, remember?

ORDELL
She got off, huh?

MAX
They decided to no-file. Tell me
where you are and I'll bring you your
money.
Ordell doesn't say anything.

MAX (CONT'D)
You still there?

ORDELL
Looky here, I know you helped her and
I know you know what I want Jackie
can tell me any story come in that
pretty head of hers. Long as at the
end of that story, she hands over my
money. She do that, we're still
friends. Now, she don't wanna be my
friend no more, tell her to think
about ol' Louis. And if she tries to
turn me in, I'll name her ass as my
accessory. We'll go upstate together.
Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that
shit's a promise, understand what I'm
sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll
call you back.
Ordell hangs up. Back in control. He looks to the TV. One
of the COMEDIANS cracks a joke. Ordell laughs.
Max looks at Winston.

MAX
You're right, that was Ordell. You
have time, you think you could find
out for me where he's staying?

WINSTON
Cops can't locate him, huh?

MAX
They don't have your winning
personality.

WINSTON
Sure thing. I don't have to know what
I'm doing, long as you know.

MAX
I think I do. Is that good enough?

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
A low-rent motel. We hear a phone ring inside one of the
rooms.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Jackie lies on a hotel bed, wearing a long t-shirt and
panties, watching TV that's chained to the wall.
She answers the phone.

JACKIE
Hello.

INT. MAX'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Max on the phone in his office, alone.

MAX
I know where he is.
This gets her attention. She picks up the remote to the
TV set and zaps the sound.

JACKIE
How'd you find out?

MAX
All Winston had to do was ask around.
Ordell's living in Long Beach with a
woman junkie.

JACKIE
How does Winston find him if A.T.F.
and all the local Police can't?

MAX
People talk to Winston. He's street,
same as them, they trust him. They
get busted, they know somebody who
can bond them out. I thought I might
drop in on him. He'll no doubt be
surprised to see me.

JACKIE
He's liable to shoot you.

MAX
On the phone I told him I have the
ten thousand he put up for your bond.
I could bring the money and the
papers for him to sign. Walk out and
call the Sheriff's department.
Jackie gets off the bed.

JACKIE
Ray wants him.

MAX
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide
suspect. It doesn't matter who brings
him in, he's gonna name you as an
accessory.
Jackie lights up a Davidoff.

JACKIE
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the
case. I'm their witness. They
wouldn't have a case without me. If
it's his word against mine, who are
they gonna believe?

MAX
It's not that simple.
Phone in one hand, smoke in the other, Jackie begins
pacing back and forth.

JACKIE
It never was, so I'm not gonna start
worrying about it now. Look, Ray more
or less believes my story, and he
more or less doesn't care. All he
really gives a shit about is getting
Ordell.

MAX
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?

JACKIE
Get Ordell to come to your office.

MAX
Set him up.

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

MAX
Tell him you want to see him?

JACKIE
Tell him I want to give him his
money.

MAX
Why?

JACKIE
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of
him. He'll like that.

MAX
What do you tell Nicolet?

JACKIE
Ordell called and wants to meet me
and I'm scared.

MAX
We get Ordell to come to my office.
Nicolet - is he already there, or
does he come busting in while we're
chatting?
Jackie takes a drag.

JACKIE
He's already there.

MAX
What if he hears something he's not
supposed to?

JACKIE
Well, we don't let that happen, now
do we?

EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
Max at the front door or Raynelle's apartment. He pounds
on the door.
Ordell throws open the door.

ORDELL
What the fuck you doin' knockin on
the door like the goddamn police? You
lookin' to get shot?

MAX
I thought you might be asleep.

ORDELL
You keep fuckin' with me, you're
gonna be asleep forever.
He looks past Max.

MAX
I'm alone.

ORDELL
Git your ass in here.
Max enters, Ordell slams the door.
As Ordell turns away from the door, Maxis reaching into
his coat. Ordell brings his Beretta up at Max.

ORDELL
You better freeze, motherfucker!
Max freezes, his hand in his coat pocket.

MAX
You want your money? Your bond
refund?
He takes his hand out, it's holding stack of bills
wrapped in a rubber band. He tosses it to Ordell, who
catches it with his free hand.

ORDELL
That's all?

MAX
I have a bond receipt for you to
sign.

ORDELL
You know what the fuck I'm talkin'
about. You talk to her?

MAX
She wants to give you your money. If
she didn't, there'd be cops batter-
ramming the door right now.

ORDELL
How'd you find me?

MAX
Winston found you.

ORDELL
How the fuck did he find me?

MAX
That's what Winston does. He finds
people who don't want to be found.

ORDELL
Well, bully for that nigga. You say
she wants to give me the money, huh?

MAX
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
Well, give it to me then.

MAX
She wants to give it to you herself
and collect her ten percent. She also
wants to explain why she had to hold
on to it.

ORDELL
I'd like to hear that too. Turn
around and put your hands on your
head.
Max does this, Ordell pats him down.

MAX
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd
already tried to get Jackie to go in
with her, split the half million
amongst themselves. What she did was
take quite a risk to see you get your
money.

ORDELL
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?

MAX
All I did was walk out with it.

ORDELL
And you did that to protect my
interest?

MAX
In a way, yes.

ORDELL
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a
dumbass. Go sit over there on the
couch.
Max does.

MAX
This place stinks.

ORDELL
You get used to it after a while. Now
tell me where my money's at.

MAX
My office.

ORDELL
And where's Jackie?

MAX
She's been there since Thursday
night.

ORDELL
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she
home?

MAX
She was afraid.

ORDELL
(laughs)
That I gotta see.

MAX
She still is. She doesn't want to get
shot before she can tell you what
happened.

ORDELL
Have her bring the money here.

MAX
It's in the safe. She can't get at
it.

ORDELL
Call her, tell her the combination.

MAX
I'm telling you, you got her spooked.
She won't leave there till you have
your money and you're gone.

ORDELL
You expect me to just walk in there?

MAX
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be
in custody right now. When you said
you'd name her as an accessory she
believed you. That scares her more
than anything.

ORDELL
That's why she's givin' up my money
huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie.
I didn't trust her ass neither, but I
knew how to handle her. She was my
blonde-headed little surfer gal. I
fuckin' told Louis he could've just
given her a punch in the mouth, he
didn't need to shoot her. She's at
your office.

MAX
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
By herself. That big mandingo nigga
Winston ain't there, is he?

MAX
She's all alone.

ORDELL
I call your office, she better answer
the phone.

MAX
She will.

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
Jackie on the phone with Ordell, sitting behind Max's
desk.

JACKIE
I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit.
She hangs up the phone. Then starts dialing again...

INT. RAY NICOLET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A STEDICAM glides through the apartment, it falls on a
beeper "beeping", a gun, a wallet and car keys on a
dresser drawer... it leaves that and lands on a TV
screen: Tom Snyder is interviewing a guest on his show
... it leaves that and falls on two empty and one quarter-
filled beer bottles... it leaves that and falls on a
sleeping Ray Nicolet passed out in his reclining chair.
The sound of Tom Snyder and the faint beeping are heard
offscreen.

EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
They leave the apartment walking to Max's car.

ORDELL
All the time I've known her, I never
heard her sound scared like that.
Ordinarily she's too cool for school.
I'm driving, gimme the keys.
Max hands him the keys. They climb in.

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
Jackie sitting behind the desk. She opens the drawer to
her right, Max's .38 sits there. She closes the drawer.

INT. CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT
Ordell behind the wheel, Max the passenger. Ordell plays
the radio, he likes the song and turns it up.

BACK TO JACKIE
Sitting alone in the office, she gets up and turns off
the lights. The office goes dark. No music.

BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
The song plays LOUD. Ordell moves his head to the music
slightly. Mak sits silently in the passenger seat,
sneaking a look at Ordell every once in a while.

BACK TO JACKIE
Sitting behind Max's desk in the dark. She takes out her
Davidoffs and lights one up with her Bic. Her face is
illuminated for a moment - then it's out. She exhales a
drag. No music.

BACK TO ORDELL

CLOSEUP ORDELL
His face is ice, the music is LOUD.

BACK TO JACKIE

CLOSEUP JACKIE
She's cool as a breeze, smoking her brand. No music.

BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
Music is LOUD. Ordell's driving. Max says;

MAX
It's the next street.

ORDELL
I know where it is.

MAX
Turn left.

ORDELL
I know where to turn.

BACK TO JACKIE
Sitting behind Max's desk. Headlights shine in the
window. She is lit by them. She puts out her Davidoff and
sits back in the chair. The light source cuts off.

BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
Sitting in the parked Cadillac. Ordell has just turned
off the lights and turns to Max, Beretta in hand.

ORDELL
My money's in that office, right?

MAX
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
She starts givin' me some bullshit
about it ain't there. It's somewhere
else and we can go get it.
(he holds up his Beretta)
I'm shootin' you in the head right
then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
her in the kneecap, find out where my
godamn money is. I go walkin' in
there and that nigga Winston or
anybody else is in there, you're the
first man shot, understand what I'm
sayin'?

MAX
Yeah.

ORDELL
Now, is there anything you want to
tell me before we get out of this
car?

MAX
No.

ORDELL
You sure?

MAX
Yes.

ORDELL
You better be, motherfucker.

EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
They both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun
in his pants.

ORDELL
Get ahead of me and open the door.
Max steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and
opens the door.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Step inside easy.
Max does.
Max sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark.
Ordell sees this, too and moves past Max.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting
in the goddamn dark for?
Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the
bathroom door on the left side of the desk open, throwing
light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps
out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus.
Max sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie.
Then Jackie says;

JACKIE
Mark...
(raising her voice)
... he's got a gun!
Max sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the
Beretta in his pants...
... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three
times in the chest...
... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
lands at Max's feet.
Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look
of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.
Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to
Ordell's body.
Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She
looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks
over to the body.
Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark
holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step
out of the bathroom.

DARGUS
He's dead.
Dargus looks up at Max;

DARGUS (CONT'D)
Does he have the marked bills on him?
Max still shaken;

MAX
In his inside coat pocket.
Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing
the forty-thousand marked dollars.
Max looks at Jackie.
She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression,
just light up another Davidoff.
Dargus looks up at Max;

DARGUS
Why were you with him?

MAX
I went to give him his refund, so he
wouldn't have to come here.

DARGUS
How'd you know where he was?

MAX
I found out.

DARGUS
And you didn't tell the Police?

MAX
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you
wanted him.
Dargus looks down at he man he just killed.

JACKIE
Remember when Ray said you hoped
you'd get him before he got me?
Dargus looks up and nods his head.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Well, you did. Thank you.
She takes a drag on her Davidoff.

FADE TO BLACK

INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
As opposed to the last scene late at night, it's early
morning. Max sits at his desk, filling out a report.

A SUB-TITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TEN DAYS LATER"
Max hears someone go;

JACKIE (O.S.)
Knock knock.
Max looks up and sees Jackie Brown, standing in the
doorway. She smiles at him.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Hey.
MAX FLASHES ON Jackie behind the desk.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Mark... he's got a gun!
Dargus shoots Ordell, Ordell drops.

BACK TO OFFICE
Max smiles back.

MAX
Hey, you.
Jackie walks toward him.

JACKIE
I got your package. It was fun
getting a half-a-million dollars in
the mail.

MAX
Less ten percent.

JACKIE
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that
out, since there wasn't no note.
She sits in the chair in front of his desk.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.

MAX
I hesitated taking that much.

JACKIE
You worked for it - if you're sure that's all
you want.

MAX
I'm sure.
Pause between them.

JACKIE
I'm leaving, I have my things in my
car. Why don't you walk out with me?
I want to show you something.
Max hesitates.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Come on, Max. I won't hurt you.
He smiles and gets up from the desk.
As she stands, Jackie says;

JACKIE (CONT'D)
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he
pissed he missed all the excitement.

MAX
What's he doing?

JACKIE
He's on to a new thing. He's after a
guy who owns a gun shop he says is
"woefully and wantonly" selling
assault rifles to minors. He says
he's gonna take him down if it's the
last thing he does.

MAX
Did you tell him you were leaving?

JACKIE
I told him I might.

EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
They walk outside and Max sees Ordell's black Mercedes
convertible.

MAX
That's Ordell's.

JACKIE
They've confiscated all his other
stuff. But this one's sorta left
over. The registration's in the glove
box, the keys were under the seat...
What's a matter" haven't you ever
borrowed someone's car?

MAX
Not after they're dead.
She walks around to the other side of the car, and looks
at him across the black Mercedes.

JACKIE
I didn't use you, Max.

MAX
I didn't say you did.

JACKIE
I never lied to you.

MAX
I know.

JACKIE
We're partners.

MAX
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't
blame anybody for anything I do.

JACKIE
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
He shakes his head 'no.'

JACKIE (CONT'D)
'd feel a whole lot better if you
took some more money.

MAX
(smiling)
You'll get over that.
Jackie smiles.

MAX (CONT'D)
Where're you going?

JACKIE
Spain.

MAX
Madrid or Barcelona?

JACKIE
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
He shakes his head 'no.'

JACKIE (CONT'D)
I hear they don't eat dinner till
midnight.
Max doesn't say anything.

JACKIE
Wanna go?

MAX
Thanks, but you have a good time.

JACKIE
Sure I can't twist your arm?

MAX
Thank you for saying that, but no. My
business.

JACKIE
I thought you were tired of your
business?

MAX
I'm just tired in general.

JACKIE
Are you scared of me?
Max smiles and holds up two fingers, close to each other.

MAX
A little bit.
Jackie smiles back.

JACKIE
Come over here.
Max does.
They give each other a long, tender kiss.
She breaks it.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
I'll send you a postcard, partner.

THE END
FADE IN:
EXT - OVER BLACK
We hear labored breathing.

BLACK FRAME
QUOTE APPEARS:

"Revenge is a dish
best served cold"

- Old Klingon Proverb - 
QUOTE FADES OUT

WE STAY ON BLACK
...breathing continues...

Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing;

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Do you find me sadistic?

CUT TO:

BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN
lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has
just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her
face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W
turning the red blood into black blood.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME
holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the
corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the
young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice
speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the
audience.
But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that
shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the
"BILL" of the title.

In another age men who shook the world for their own purposes
were called conquerors. In our age, the men who shake the
planet for their own power and greed are called corrupters.
And of the world's corrupters Bill stands alone. For while he
corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.

BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
I bet I could fry an egg on your
head about now, if I wanted to.

He continues wiping away the blood.

BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even
now, you're aware enough to know
there isn't  a trace of sadism in
my actions... Okay - Maybe towards
these other jokers - bot not your.

OVERHEAD SHOT
We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on
the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others
in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is
male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.
We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated
by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending
on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
white bridal gown.
This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she
will only be referred to as The BRIDE.

Back to CU of The BRIDE.

The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.

BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
No Kiddo at this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in
the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and
says;

THE BRIDE
Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride
receives a bullet in the side of her head.

CUT TO:
BLACK SCREEN: Presentation Credit

"The 4th Film by
QUENTIN TARANTINO"

CUT TO:

B/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.

The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.

CU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two
bullet holes in her.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's his girlfriend Janeen.

CU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still
clutched in her dead fist.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's my best friend from work
Erica.

AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's the minister. I think his
name was Reverend Hillhouse.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower
print dress.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's his wife.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Organ player, don't know her name.

A YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The
name on his driver's license was
Charles Arthur Plympton, but for
some reason he preferred Arthur.
Maybe if he went by Carles people
would have called him Charlie. If
that was his reason for going by
Arthur I can understand it.
Nothing wrong with the name
Charlie, except he didn't look like
a Charlie, he looked like an
Arthur.
Obviously you'll have to take my
word on this. Speaking of names, I
was about two seconds away from
becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur
Plympton.

And then finally, The Bride.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.

We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal
gown

To

The Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the
asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the
past, because she looks like a million dollars
now.......three million even.

INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia
convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A
PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Looked dead, didn't I? Well I
wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo
trying, I can tell you that.
Actually Bill's last bullet put me
in a coma. A coma I was to lie in
for five years.
When I woke up, ...I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to
as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I
roarded and I rampaged and I got
bloody satisfaction. In all, I've
killed 33 people to get to this
piont right now.
I have only one more.
The last one.
The one I'M driving to right now.
The only one left.
And when I arrive at my
destination.....
.... I'm gonna Kill Bill.

TITLE SEQUENCE

As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the
soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the
Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.

The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.

WE FADE TO BLACK

BLACK FRAME
TITLE APPEARS:

Chapter one

"2"

CUT TO:

EX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR
WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A
CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR
She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on
something.

The BRIDE'S POV:
A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of
Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the
driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle
the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The
BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't
see ice cream truck bells.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM:

"The city of
PASADENA, CALIFORNIA"

We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks
into the shot, heading for the front door.

EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY

The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the
same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the
blonde on her doorstep.

The BRIDE
on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her
eyes.

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.

The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.

INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY

The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of
the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of
the sofa.

These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER
the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing
together on the plush carpet.

The HOUSEWIFE
KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the
small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and
the mail is kept.

The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a
FLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both
into........

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has
framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a
collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the
negro experience in the American military. Starting with a
plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro
troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers
fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,
the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and
finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH
THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked
in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...
When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.

The HOUSEWIFE
hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and
comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.

The BRIDE
rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath
hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,
double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what
Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)

The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally
demolished living room.

The two woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each
looking like they know how to use it, each waiting for the
other to make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep
into the other one.

Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women
locked in life and death combat......

....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.

FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
Mommy, I'm home!

The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat
concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year
old's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to
the eyes of The Bride.

The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."

The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons
behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks
into the newly destroyed living room.

The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Hey baby, how was school?

The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the
condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a
bar room brawl.

LITTLE GIRL
Mommy, what happened to you and the
T.V. Room?

THE HOUSEWIFE
Oh, that good for nothin dog of
yours, got his little ass in the
living room and acted a damn fool,
that's what happened.

LITTLE GIRL
Barney did this?

She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries
to enter the living room.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Now baby, you can't come in here,
there's broken glass all over the
floor, and you gonna cut yourself.

The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living
room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like
she's been fighting.

The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl.

THE HOUSEWIFE
This is a old friend of mommy's I
ain't seen in a long time.

THE BRIDE
Hello sweety, I'm (BLEEP), what's
your name?

 Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real
name, it will be BLEEPED OUT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, ...that is,
till I want you to know. 

The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she
just stares at the blond lady.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Her name is Nikki.

THE BRIDE
Nikki. What a pretty name for such
a pretty little girl. How old are
you Nikki?

Nikki still says nothing, only stares.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Nikki, (BLEEP) aked you a
question.

NIKKI
(to The Bride)
I'm four.

THE BRIDE
Four years old, aye. You know I
once had a little girl. She'd be
five right now. Maybe you two could
of played with each other.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Now baby, me an (BLEEP) have some
grown-up talk to talk about, so you
go in your room now and leave us
alone till I tell you to come out.

The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.

THE HOUSEWIFE
(snapping her fingers)
Nikkia - in your room - now.

The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the
door of her bedroom.

The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat
both finished.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Want some coffee?

THE BRIDE 
Yeah, sure.

The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her
SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the
drawer.

The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife
pours both of them coffee.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Cream and sugar?

THE BRIDE
Both, please.

As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's
VOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
This Pasadena homemaker's name is
Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.
Lawrence Bell. But back when we
were acquainted, five years ago,
her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her
code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine
was BLACK MAMBA.

The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking
coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.

THE BRIDE
Were you expecting me?

VERNITA
Yes and no. Bill got in touch with
me right after you woke up, and
then again a little later after
your episode in Japan.
(pause)
So I suppose it's a little late for
a apology, huh?

THE BRIDE
You suppose correctly.

VERNITA
Even if I was sincere?

THE BRIDE
Oh. I'm quite positive you're
sorry, now.

Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with
low volume;

VERNITA
Look bitch, I need to know if
you're gonna start anymore shit
around my baby girl!

THE BRIDE
You can relax for now. I'm not
going to murder you in front of
your daughter.

VERNITA
That's being more rational than
Bill led me to believe you were
capable of.

THE BRIDE
Well that's a demonstration of
Bill's complete ignorance when it
comes to the subject of me, and
what I'm thinking, and what I might
do. It's mercy, compassion, and
forgiveness I lack, not
rationality.

She pauses for effect -- the ham.

THE BRIDE
I'll wait for now, but I won't wait
for long. I'll allow you to choose
a time and place for us to meet
again, preferably as far away from
Nikki as possible.
I could have just HIT you, I
didn't, I demand respect for that.
Since this is not a HIT, consider
it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly
Vipers, we will observe Viper rules
of honor. One on one - no help - no
bushwhackin - no treacherous
weapons - on weapon of choice - our
skill and our bodies.

Vernita says her name;

VERNITA
(BLEEP)

THE BRIDE
- I'm not through telling you.
Failure to keep our date, or
duplicity of any kind, will result
in me putting a xoxo hollow point
bullet into the back of your skull
from a window of a building across
the street from Nikki's elementary
school. Now, feel free to respond.

VERNITA
Look...I know I fucked you over. I
fucked you over bad. I wish to God
I hadn't, but I did.

The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.

VERNITA
If I could go back in a machine I
would, but I can't. All I can tell
you is I'm a different person now.

THE BRIDE
I don't care.

VERNITA
Be that as it may, I know I do not
deserve mercy or forgiveness.
However, I beseech you for both on
behalf of my daughter.

THE BRIDE
-- Bitch, you can stop right there.

The B-word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed
slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as
well).

THE BRIDE
(leans in close)
Just because I have no wish to
murder you before the eyes of your
daughter, does not mean parading
her around in front of me is going
to inspire sympathy. You and I have
unfinished business.
And not a goddamn fuckin thing
you've done in the subsequent five
years - including getting knocked
up - is going to change that.

VERNITA
You have every right to wanna get
even --

THE BRIDE
-- But that's where you're wrong,
Vernita. I don't want to get even.
To get even, even Steven. I would
have to kill you, go into Nikki's
room, kill her, then wait for your
old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and
kill him. That would make us even.
No, my unborn daughter will just
hafta be satisfied with your death
at her mother's hands.

Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.

VERNITA
When do we do this?

THE BRIDE
It all depends... When do you want
to die? Tomorrow? The day after
tomorrow? That's about as long as
I'll wait.

VERNITA
How bout tonight, bitch?

THE BRIDE
Spendid. Where?

VERNITA
There's a baseball diamond where
our little league has its games,
about a mile from here. We meet
there around two-thirty in the
morning, dressed all in black, your
hair in a black stocking, and we
have us a knife fight, we won't be
bothered. I have to fix Nikki's
cereal.

As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl
for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.

THE BRIDE
Bill said you were one of the best
ladies he'd ever seen with an edged
weapon.

Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a
box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."

VERNITA
Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't
qualify it, so you can just kiss my
motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.
(snorts to herself)
Black Mamba, I shoulda been
motherfuckin Black Mamba.

As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand
inside the cereal box.

THE BRIDE
Weapon of choice? And if you want
to stick with your butcher knife,
I'm cool with that.

VERNITA
Very funny.

Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The
Bride....

.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS
the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO
SMITHEREENS.

The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....

Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES
again...

...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her
back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT
INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and
the kitchen counter.

While her left hand holds the table, her right hand goes to
the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap around the blade's
grip, lifting it up out of the sheath and PLUNGING IT THROUGH
THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with all the SOG's steel
entering Vernita's abdomen.

The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker
pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.

VERNITA
Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
don't...

THE BRIDE
Do to your daughter, what you did
to mine...
(she takes her hand)
...I won't.

Vernita dies.

The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki
standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her
mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she
sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife
still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The
little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her
stare.

As she talks to the little girl, she removes an already
stained with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"
sewn on it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood
off her blade.

THE BRIDE
It was not my intention to do this
in front of you. For that I'm
sorry. But you can take my word for
it, your mother had it coming. When
you grow up, if you still feel raw
about it, I'll be waiting.

And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride
walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to
her mourning.

EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY

The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her
vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she
makes here getaway.

She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words
"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a
pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a
page that's headline reads;

DEATH LIST FIVE

On the pager are five names numbered going down the page
written in red ink.

The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.

The second name on the list is;

VERNITA GREEN
COBRA

The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through
Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of
the residential district.

FADE UP ON

CU The comatose Bride
lying in her hospital bed, wide open unblinking sightless
eyes, that constantly stare yet see nothing. The Bride is at
the beginning of her comatose journey.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
under her face.

"Five years and four months earlier
in the city of El Paso, Texas"

Although we're only in a tight CU, we can tell a few things:
one, she's in her hospital room; two, she's alone; three,
it's night; and four, one hellva RAINSTORM is pounding
outside.

EXT. EL PASO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The rain pisses down in buckets in front of the hospital...

WHEN...

The wheel to an Alfa Romeo rolls into FRAME and stops.

The car door opens and two yellow galoshes step out into the
wet night.

OVERHEAD SHOT
A red umbrella opens as rain falls down.

CU the back of a head wearing a yellow rainslicker hood,
framed by the red umbrella above it, which water cascades
down and beats a rhythm against.

The figure in the yellow rainslicker with the red umbrella
(who we can guess is female) starts walking towards the
hospital.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The door marked "ladies" is opened, and a beautiful 6-foot
blonde in a white nurse's uniform, with a matching white eye
patch over her left eye, steps out, carrying the nurse's tray
with the "Goodbye forever"-filled syringe on it.
She walks down the corridor towards The sleeping Bride's
room.

INT. THE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The Bride, alone in her bed, alone in her coma, alone in her
room.

Elle Driver opens the door to her room and steps inside.
The female assassin approaches the comatose woman.

EX CU ELLE DRIVER'S EYE AND WHITE EYE PATCH
looking down at her sleeping target, victim, rival, and
opposite number.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES
wide open - blank stare.

Elle standing over The Bride's hospital bed, says to her;

ELLE
I might never of liked you. Point
in fact I despise you. But that
doesn't suggest I don't respect
you. You were a master of a
profession that's most difficult to
master.
Dying in our sleep is a luxury our
kind is rarely afforded. My gift to
you.

As she lifts the syringe off the tray....

Her cell phone RINGS....

She curses to herself...there can be only one person on the
other end....she answers it.

ELLE
Hello, Bill.
(pause)
Affirmative.
(pause)
Comatose.
(pause)
I'm standing over her right now.
(pause)
What!

The female assassin turns away from the wide-eyed stare of
The Bride, and paces the hospital room talking in the cell
phone.

ELLE
Don't fuckin ssshhh me! If you
think I came all the way down to
Texas - in a dog and cat rainstorm
no less - just to tuck sleeping
beauty in bed - you got another
fuckin thing comin -
(pause, then real loud)
You don't owe her Shit!!
(then again, but quieter)
You don't owe her shit.
(pause)
Man, fuck that bitch!
(pause)
Oh you're not are you? Well Bill,
you never leave a job half done.
A great teacher taught me that
once, he looked a whole lot like
you.

Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say. We don't
hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks. We can tell by
her face, he's making some sense. After awhile she answers
back;

ELLE
I guess.
(pause)
No, I don't need to guess, I know.
(pause)
Affirmative.
(pause)
I love you too, bye bye.

The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The
comatose Bride with the open eyes. Even though her face is
expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling.

ELLE
Thought that was pretty funny
didn't ya? Word of advice shithead,
don't you ever wake up.

Elle leans closer to the Bride's face.

ELLE
Ya know now I get a better look at
you, you're not so damn pretty.
Yeah, you go that Venus thing going
for you but...ya know, now I get a
closer look at you you're kinda
weird looking. You got this big
nose that doesn't fit with the rest
of your face, your eyes are two
different sizes. And look at your
skin...My complexion is way better
than yours --

The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions...She SPITS
in Elle's face.

Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down
at The comatose Bride in her bed.

ELLE
Oh, no you didn't.

She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown...

....Yanks Her up to a sitting position...

...And PUNCHES her hard in the face three times.

ELLE
If you ever take your ass out of
this Goddamn bed for as long as you
fuckin live, I will beat you into
the ground, bitch!

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Elle Driver in her nurse's uniform, angrily walks down the
hallway. She passes by a DOCTOR, STRUGGLING WITH A PATIENT
BLEEDING PROFUSELY on a gurney.

DOCTOR
(yelling)
Nurse come here quick, we're losing
this man!

Elle doesn't even look back.

ELLE
Tough titty, I quit.

She walks out of the SHOT.

FADE TO BLACK.

CUT TO:

INT. THE COMATOSE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA is in a corner of the ceiling, looking down on the
comatose Bride, who lies motionless in her bed.

WE HEAR the sound of a BUZZING MOSQUITO, doing loop de loops
and figure eights in the air, looking for some warm blood.

The BUZZING stops....

MACRO CU
of mosquito on The Bride's forearm, its stinger dug in her
flesh, visibly drawing blood from its host.

CU MOSQUITO'S FACE
drinking her blood.

MACROSHOT OF MOSQUITO ON FOREARM
drinking blood...when The Bride's hand comes into FRAME and
SQUASHES the bug flat. Her fingers FLICK the dead bug away.

CU The Bride
her wide-open eyes, that have stared in a constant gaze for
the last five years,
finally...slowly...softly...shut.

They SUDDENLY POP OPEN.

The BRIDE SITS BOLD UPRIGHT IN BED.
She has no idea where the fuck she is. WE DO A SHAW BROTHERS
STYLE QUICK ZOOM INTO A CU OF HER FACE.

QUICK CUT TO A FLASHBACK SPAGHETTI-WESTERN STYLE
back at the wedding chapel, gun pointed down at our face.

THE BARREL EXPLODES LEAT AT US - BANG!

QUICK CUT BACK TO The BRIDE IN HER HOSPITAL BED,
BANK still echoing in her ears. She lets out a SCREAM OF PAIN
and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were
just shot.

Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her
skull where the hole was. She knocks against it with her
knuckle...it goes...TINK...TINK.

Suddenly she says out loud;

THE BRIDE
My baby.

Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen
but flat. She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown
and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen. Her
fingertips trace it.

She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the
lines.

MACRO CU The LINES IN HER PALM look like a road map.

She stops counting, shocked;

THE BRIDE
(to herself)
Five years.

She counts again.

THE BRIDE
(a statement)
Five years.

The Bride's two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby
is long gone.

WHEN SUDDENLY...

She hears the STEP...STEP...STEP...OF BILL'S BOOTS WALKING
TOWARDS HER ROOM....

WE SEE THE CINEMATIC EQUIVALENT OF A COMIC BOOK THOUGHT
BALLOON by her head. INSIDE OF IT WE SEE BILL'S BLACK BOOTS
walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (THE BRIDE'S FLOOR) - NIGHT

We see a HOSPITAL ORDERLY'S bright red and white Reeboks
softly slapping against the smooth surface of the
institution's floor. They make a sound nothing like Bill's
shoes.

SCREEN GOES TO SPLIT SCREEN

LEFT SIDE                    RIGHT SIDE
The BRIDE listening to them         Orderly's Reeboks walking
getting closer. WE HEAR the         down the hospital
STEP...STEP...STEP...in time        corridor.
with Orderly's sneakers.

CAMERA MOVES UP TO
Orderly's face, leading
two TRUCKDRIVERS.
The Bride HEARS BILL'S
VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY;

BILL'S VOICE                         ORDERLY
(in time)                           (in time)
She's right in here.             She's right in here.

SPLIT SCREEN FINISHES
STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN

The Bride decides the best course of action, till she gets
her bearings, is to play possum. She throws herself back down
on the bed, just as the three men enter her room.
They see just what they expected to see, The Bride lying in
her bed in her coma.

She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.
Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of
her, creates a slightly different effect.

The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for
what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when
The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE
BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.

The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her
hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind
of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina.

THE ORDERLY
Now is that the cutest little
blonde pussy you ever saw, or is
that the cutest little blonde
pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW?

Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren)
fronts.

WARREN
I seen better.

CU The BRIDE
EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being
exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her
trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load
better than you, fatass."

THE ORDERLY
Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I
know damn well this is the best
pussy you ever saw you had touchin
rights to. The price is seventy
five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you
gittin your freak on or what?

The Truckers pay the bill of fare.

As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the
rules;

THE ORDERLY
Here's the rules; Rule number one;
no punchin 'er.
Nurse comes in tomorrow an she got
'er a shiner - or less some teeth,
jig's up. So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances. And by the
way, this little cunt's a spitter -
it's a motor reflex thing but spit
or no, no punchin. Now are we
absolutely positively clear about
rule number one?

TWO TRUCKERS
Yeah.

THE ORDERLY
Rule number two;
No monkey bites, no hickeys - in
fact no leavin no marks of no kind.
But after that, it's allll goooood.
Her plummin down there don't work
no more, so feel free to cum in 'er
all ya wont. Keep the noise down -
try not to make a mess, and I'll be
back in twenty.

The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and
turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline
in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.

THE ORDERLY
Oh by the way, not all the time,
but sometimes this cunt's cunt can
get drier than a bucket of sand.
If she dry, lube up with this and
you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,
gentlemen.

And with that, The Orderly's gone.

The BRIDE'S POV:
As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren
begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.
While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV
BLINKS.

GERALD
Hey Warren, she just blinked.

WARREN
He said she can't blink.

GERALD
I know what he said, I'm tellin ya
she just did.

Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles.

WARREN
Just wait, when I get through with
this little dumbbell, she gonna
stand up and recite the Gettysburg
Ad-dress.

Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.
Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.

WARREN
Hey, Gerald.

GERALD
Yeah?

WARREN
This shit ain't no peep show. Go
out in the hall and I'll let ya
know when it's your turn.

GERALD
Awww c'mon, I gotta leave the room?

WARREN
I can't get no errection wit you
lookin at me, so go on.

GERALD
Well, just hurry up then.

Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT

Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.

THEN...

He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE
A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;

GERALD
He man, keep it down in there, I
can hear your ass out here.

More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...

THEN...

The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.

INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His
buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The
Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.

He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose
Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the
front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the
I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT
AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into
scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.
She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.

The BRIDE
upon waking, without leaving the bed where she lay the last
five years, has just killed two men. She throws off the
bloody blankets, whips her legs off the side of the bed, and
tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE
CRASH BELOW FRAME.

The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.
Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning
top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl
to do?

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.

BACK TO The BRIDE
She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...
STEP...STEP...STEP...

She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached
to his belt. Her hands removes it.

The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red
Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor.

CU The BRIDE
She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.

The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

The ORDERLY'S POV:
He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead
Truckers on the floor, and no Bride.

ORDERLY
Oh shit!

WE GO TO SLOW MOTION as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past
shirts - pants - to his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE
The BRIDE, curled up low next to the doorway, behind his
ankles, knife ready. WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He
steps into the room; when he does The Bride reaches out and
SLASHES both of his Achilles tendons.

The STANDING ORDERLY
lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

IMPACT CUT
The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.

The BRIDE (Confined to the floor)
crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,
placing his melon head between the door and the door frame.
Then taking the door in her right hand.

SLAM!

SLAM!

SLAM!

SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR
FRAME.

The ORDERLY
lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in
both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,
since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at
The comatose Bride asking him questions.

THE BRIDE
Where's Bill?

THE ORDERLY
(hurt and confused)
Who?

SLAM!

He screams.

THE BRIDE
Bill! Where is Bill!

THE ORDERLY
I dunno no Bill.

SLAM!

THE BRIDE
I saw him here myself.....
SLAM!
....Now do you tell me where he is,
or do I beat your fuckin brains in?

SLAM!

THE ORDERLY
Please please stop, don't hit me
again!

THE BRIDE
Where is Bill?

SLAM!

Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,
that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it
from around his neck.

THE BRIDE
Where did you get this from?

THE ORDERLY
That's mine.

SLAM!

THE BRIDE
Bullshit! I saw Bill wearing it in
this room ten minutes ago.

SLAM!

Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the
Orderly's hand - one spelling "B.U.C.K." on each finger of
his left hand. And another spelling "F.U.C.K." on the fingers
of his right.

The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she
does this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her
REMEMBERING THEME).

WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -
We see Buck enter her room that first night, five years
ago.... He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights
you use in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue
light. Buck examines The Bride through the blue.

BUCK
Well, ain't you the slice of cutie
pie they all said you wuz. Well
Ma'am, I'm from Longview Texas, my
name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

He starts to unbuckle his belt.

WE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS
OFF. She looks down at Buck and says;

THE BRIDE 
Your name's Buck, right? And you
came to fuck, right?

A "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face.

The Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS
PLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER
FOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME
WITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with
a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid
movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic
anticipation of the carnage to come...

...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this
Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.

She searches the dead man's pockets, coming up with a brown
wallet that says on it, "BIG EL PASO PIMPIN," loaded with
lettuce. She also pulls out a set of car keys on a pickup
truck key chain that has the words, "Pussy Wagon" on it
written in a pimpy font. She gathers up all these items, and
Gerald's knife, then begins to strip Buck of his orderly
uniform.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot
open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a
wheelchair.

She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her
arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,
looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.

What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4
hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,
and the words, "PUSSY WAGON," written along the flat-bed
hatch door. Pimpy font.

The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.

EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.

EX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN.

INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup
truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.

It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.

Now The Bride's lying vertically in Buck's truck's backseat.
Seemingly out of danger - at least out of sight - but she's
still stuck hiding in the hospital. And until she regains
full use of her legs and feet, this little Bride ain't goin
anywhere or doin anything.

Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the
door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,
her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,
the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her
strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO HER FACE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO FACE.

THE BRIDE
(monotone)
Wiggle your big toe.

Toe doesn't move an inch.

THE BRIDE 
Wiggle your big toe.

It doesn't move.

THE BRIDE
Wiggle your big toe.
(VOICE OVER)
As I lay in the back of Buck's
pickup truck, trying to will my
limbs out of entropy, I could see
the faces of the cunts who did this
to me, and the dick responsible.
Members all of Bill's brainchild;
"The Deadly Viper Assassination

fated by God vengeance would have
it, I who knew nothing - knew one
thing. As sure as God made little
green apples...

WE MOVE FAST TO O-REN ISHII'S SILHOUETTE, The SILHOUETTE
BECOMES A POSED PICTURE OF O-REN in all her Deadly Viper
glory.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
(continued)
....if O-Ren Ishii, the first name
on my Death List, was still
alive... she'd live in Japan. O-Ren
Ishii, made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of eleven.

FLASH ON
CU O-REN (11-years old), hiding under a bed, watching...

...her FATHER (dressed in the uniform of a sergeant for the
American Army) fighting THREE YAKUZA GANGSTERS. He kills one
with his bare hands. The other two slice him to death with
samurai swords...

...and her MOTHER being raped by the same men. When they
finish, they SHOOT her.

Little O-Ren watches, hidden from sight, withi the eyes and
face of a stone.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
It was at that age, a half-Chinese,
half-Japanese American Army brat
witnessed the murder of her Master
Sergeant father. And the rape, then
murder of her mother at the hands
of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza
boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore
revenge...luckily for her, Boss
Matsumoto was a pedophile.

SHOCK CUT
O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS
CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a
geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl
uniform.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
At thirteen, she got her revenge.

The Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the
room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun
from a holster strapped to her thigh.

The 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
on a rooftop with a high-powered, scope-sight rifle up to her
eye. Her EYE is HUGELY MAGNIFIED in the SCOPE.

THE BRIDE 
By twenty, she was one of the tip
top of female assassins in the
world.

She fires.

INT. CAR - DAY

A Central American General riding backseat of his government
vehicle. TWO BEAUTIFUL LATIN WOMEN in one-piece bathing suits
sit on either side of him. They both wear sashes down their
front; one reads, "Miss Panama," the other reads, "Miss
Venezuela." As we cut to this shot, he has both hands on each
of their bare knees. He's laughing as the TOP OF HIS HEAD is
BLOWN OFF.

The 23-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
stands before Bill and The Bride. (Bill is not clearly
viewed.)

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
At twenty-three she joined Bill's
Deadly Vipers...

The 25-YEAR-OLD O-REN ISHII
BEATING UP the pregnant Bride with the other Vipers...

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
At twenty five she did her part in
the killing of eight innocent
people, including my unborn
daughter, in a small wedding chapel
in El Paso Texas. But on that day,
five years ago, she made one big
mistake...

POSED FIGURE of the BRIDE in all her pre-beating bridal gown
glory.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
...she Should of killed nine.
However, before statisfaction would
be mine, first things first...

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Pavement of the parking lot. We HEAR a CAR DOOR OPEN
OFFSCREEN, then The Bride's bare foot comes from above FRAME,
stepping down INTO The SHOT.

She walks around to the driver's side and climbs in.

She sticks Buck's ignition key in its slot and turns.

The truck's engine RUMBLES to life.

She spies a pair of Elvis T.C.B. SUNGLASSES lying on the
dash. She puts them on.

EXT. TEXAS STREETS/ INT. TEXAS STORES - DAY

The Bride drives Buck's big, yellow pussy wagon all over El
Paso buying supplies.

WE FOLLOW Her bare feet into a clothing store.

Her feet, legs, and ass slip into a new pair of LEVI'S.

Her hands grab a pair of CHERRY BROWN COWBOY BOOTS.

Then slips on the cowboy boots.

Chooses another TOP.

And finds a warm JACKET.

She opens Buck's "BIG EL PASO PIMPIN" wallet, and pays for
the items.

She emerges from the store wearing her new outfit, and climbs
back in the truck.

She drives, stopping at a DEPARTMENT STORE, and walking
inside.

She picks up a SHOVEL, a HAND PICKAXE, a big CAMPING
FLASHLIGHT, a MAP OF TEXAS, a writing NOTEBOOK, and a bunch
of RED and BLACK FELT PENS.

While the Bride is buying items in the department store we'll
CROSSCUT....

....with her driving the pussy wagon up to a low-rent motel
called, "The Texican"....

...Her Registering with the OLD BASTARD of a desk clerk,
getting the key, and paying him out of the "BIG EL PASO
PIMPIN" wallet....

...her drawing a bath in the bathroom of the motel room...

Shampoo is taken off the shelf of the department store...

...conditioner...

...a bar of soap...

...hot water runs out of the bathtub faucet...

...steam rises off the hot bathwater...

...she pulls down a bunch of bath products, like bubble bath,

items in the bathwater...

...then we see her bare foot enter the bathwater...

...then Lower her whole body into the bathwater...

...now submerged in the warm bathwater, by herself, perfect
MUSIC CUE ON SOUNDTRACK, she begins to cry...her poor heart
has been shattered and five years of tears come flooding out
of her.

She cries for her baby...

She cries for the motherhood robbed from her...

She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel,
who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her
path...

She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover...

She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades...

She cries for the five years of life snatched from her...

She cries for the countless violations she endured while
incapacitated...

And finally, she cries for all the misery she will cause the
undeserving......enroute to Bill's retribution. Retribution
that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub.

She curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm
water...weeping.

We DOLLY back...to give our heroine some privacy...WE
DISSOLVE through the bathroom door...Till we're on the other
side, filming a closed door with crying on the other side.

When she's finished shedding tears, is when she'll begin
shedding blood.

When the bathroom door opens, the woman that emerges, has
closed out all of her emotions...save from one...revenge.

It's that woman, in her new outfit, that climbs into the
yellow pussy wagon, puts the T.C.B. Sunglasses over her eyes,
and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to
follow.

EXT./INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:
The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of
prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil
derrick pumping up and down.

The Bride STOPS the truck.

Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the
headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.

She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.

She smiles. If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken
it as a sign that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.
But as it is there, it would appear that fortune has smiled
on The Bride and her bloody intentions.

She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand
pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and
CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM.

CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS
next to the X ROCK
IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out
ten paces from the rock.
When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT
illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking
deep in the unmarked earth.

EXT. TEXAS DESERT - NIGHT

Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights
of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the
ground......TILL...

She HITS SOMETHING HARD.

She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the
hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is
revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.

She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army
footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in
the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,
she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the
rim.

Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the
department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of
her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.

We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.

The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the sonogram
back in the envelope.

1 CLEAR ZIP-LOCK BAG containing a PHONY I.D. and BANK BOOK
both w/ the name "CANDY RALSTON" on them. Reaching back in
the locker she pulls out the final item,

The MAN From
OKINAWA

FADE UP ON

INT. SUSHI BAR (OKINAWA, JAPAN) - DAY

The ENTRANCE to a tiny sushi bar, covered by a Japanese
curtain....

SUBTITLE APPEARS:

"The City of
OKINAWA, JAPAN"

....The fabric is moved aside, and The Bride enters the shot,
and the tiny establishment.

The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word
cozy. Besides The Bride, the only other person inside is The
SUSHI CHEF, who smiles at her behind the midget bar.

This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde
western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
English?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Almost -- American.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Ahhhh,...America, welcome...
Welcome... My English -- Very good.

The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside. She
doesn't come across as one of the world's deadliest
assassins, but instead as a sweet, slightly airheaded,
American tourist.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Domo.

The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise, and
says;

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Oh, "Domo", Very good -- very good,
you speak Japanese?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Nooo, just a few words I learned
since yesterday. - May I sit at the
bar?

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Sure sure sure - sit. What other
words did you learn - excuse me --

The Sushi Chef YELLS IN JAPANESE, to someone OFFSCREEN.

The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to
imagine there could be a back room to it.

Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling
to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
-- What other Japanese you learn?

The Bride puts on a thinking face.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Oh...let's see..."Arigato."

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
"Arigato"...Very good.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
..."Ah-So"...

SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
"Ah-So!" You know what "Ah-So"
means

THE BRIDE
"I See."

SUSHI CHEF
I see - Very good.

THE BRIDE
I already said "Domo", right?

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Yes.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
"Kon-netie-wa."

The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the
answer to a mystery.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
..."Kon-nichi-wa"...repeat please.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
"Kon-nichi-wa?"

Saying with surprise and admiration;

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Most impressive...you say Japanese
words, like you Japanese.

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle.

THE BRIDE
Now you're making fun of me.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
No no no - serious business.
Pronunciation - very good. You say
"Arigato" ...like we say "Arigato."

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Well, thank you - I mean...arigato.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
You should learn Japanese - very
easy.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
No kidding, I heard it's kinda
hard.

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or
understand you, he yells the word;

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What!

And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately
afterwards.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I always heard it was difficult.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Yes yes yes - most difficult. But
you have Japanese tongue.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Maybe I was Japanese in another
life.

The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know;

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Most definitely, most definitely
Japanese in another life.

He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young
blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
How did you know tuna's my
favorite?

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What!

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Tuna's my favorite.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Ah, thank you very much.

He YELLS OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE
MAN with a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He
heads for the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in
Japanese, "What she wants to drink?"

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
(to the bald man)
I beg your pardon?

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
- Drink -

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Ahhh sake,
(he holds up his thumb)
Very good.

In Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald
Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
First time in Japan?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
A-huh.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What!

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Yes, this is my first time.

As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he
asks;

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What brings you to Okinawa?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I came to see a man.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Aaahh, you have friend live in
Okinawa?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Not quite.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Not friend?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I've never met him.

The Sushi Chef continues slicing.....

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Who is he, may I ask?

THE BRIDE
Hattori Hanzo.

There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he
brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth.

The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he
pours one for The Bride, then disappears again.

As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef.

As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride.

The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that
point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks;

SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
What do you want with Hattori
Hanzo?

The Bride answers in Japanese;

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I need Japanese steel.

SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
Why do you need Japanese steel?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I have vermin to kill.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
You must have big rats you need
Hattori Hanzo steel.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Huge.

INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY

The trap door in the floor opens up, and HATTORI HANZO (Sushi
Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride.

The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved
wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of
the second half of the attic.

The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and
touching the shiny wood. She looks behind her to Hanzo who is
still by the trap door, and says;

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
May I?

The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH;

HANZO (ENGLISH)
Yes you may.....

She starts reaching for one...

HANZO (ENGLISH)
...try the second one down in the
sixth row on your left.

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath.

Her hand lifts it from the rack.

She UNSHEATHS the steel, partially....then with GREAT
FLOURISH....completely.

Hanzo's mouth froms a smile.

HANZO (ENGLISH)
Funny, you like samurai swords...

He pulls a baseball out of his pocket.

HANZO (ENGLISH)
...I like baseball.

THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The
Bride's head....

QUICK AS A WHIP, SHE SLICES THE BALL IN HALF, IN MID AIR.

The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor.

He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards
her.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
I wanted to show you these....
However someone as you, who knows
so much must surely know, I no
longer make instruments of death. I
keep these here for their ascetic
and sentimental value.
(he takes both sword and
sheath from her...)
Yet proud tho I am of my life's
work...
(...he closes them
together)
I am retired.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Then give me one of these.

HANZO (ENGLISH)
These are not for sale.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I didn't say, sell me. I said, give
me.

HANZO (ENGLISH)
And why should I be obliged to
assist you in the extermination of
your vermin?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Because my vermin, is a former
student of yours. And considering
the student, I'd say you had a
rather large obligation.

Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name,
"BILL" on it with his finger.

The blonde girl nods her head yes.

The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor,
throwing it open.

He points into a corner...

HANZO (JAPANESE)
...You can sleep there...

.....starts to descend....

HANZO (JAPANESE)
...it will take me a week to make
the sword...

.....before his head disappears, he says;

HANZO (JAPANESE)
...I suggest you spend it
practicing.

...he closes the door behind him.

She smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes
out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off.

FADE TO BLACK.

to God 28 years ago to never do
again. I've created, "something
that kills people." And in that
purpose I was a success.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
I've done this, because
philosophically I'm sympathetic to
your aim.

EX CU The HANZO SWORD
TRACKING EX CU of the Hanzo sword in its shiny, black wood
sheath. At the base of the sheath, by the handle, he's carved
the face of a lioness...

HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
I can tell you with no ego, this is
my finest sword. If on your
journey, you should encounter God,
God will be cut.

CU HANZO.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
Revenge is never a straight line.
It's a forest. And like a forest
it's easy to lose your way...to get
lost...
to forget where you came in. To
serve as a compass, a combat
philosophy must be adopted that can
be found in the secret doctrine of
the Yagu Ninja. And now my yellow
haired warrior, repeat after me;

We go back and forth between CU of HANZO reciting the
doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the Bride
repeating it.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
"When engaged in combat, the
vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern...

The Bride repeats this...

HANZO (JAPANESE)
...This is the first and cardinal
rule of combat...

The Bride repeats this...

HANZO (JAPANESE)
...Suppress all human emotion and
compassion...

The Bride repeats this...

HANZO (JAPANESE)
...Kill whoever stands in thy way,
even if that be Lord God, or Buddha
himself...

The Bride repeats this...

HANZO (JAPANESE)
This truth lies at the heart of the
art of combat. Once it is
mastered... Thou shall fear no
one... Though the devil himself may
bar thy way...

The Bride repeats this... Her eyes look at the greatest maker
of swords on this earth and says;

THE BRIDE
Domo.

SHOWDOWN
at
HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES

CUT TO:

A BLANK PIECE OF DRAWING PAPER
A hand comes in and, as the Bride talks over this image,
draws with a piece of charcoal, a portrait of the geisha
regaled O-REN ISHII.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
When fortune smiles on something as
violent and ugly as revenge, at the
time it seems proof like no other,
that not only does God exist,
you're doing his will. At a time
when I knew the last about my
enemies, the first name on my death
list, was the easiest to find. But
of course, when one manages the
difficult task of becoming queen of
the Tokyo underworld, one doesn't
keep it a secret, does one?

The charcoal drawing gets color and becomes ANIMATED, turning
into a JAPAMATION O-REN...

JAPANESE ANIMATION SEQUENCE
We see Japamation-style images of The Bride's verbiage.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
At the age of twenty, Bill backed
his Nippon progeny financially and
philosophically in her
Shakespearian-in-magnitude power
struggle with the other Yakuza
clans, over who would rule vice in
the city of Tokyo.

Japamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER
YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the
real life real McCoy samurai sword battle.

O-Ren's ability is simply amazing.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
When it was all over, it was the
geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that
proved the victor.

INT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB

O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the
city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO
BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with
much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
And just in case you're wondering
how could a half breed Japanese
Chinese American become the boss of
all criminal activity in Tokyo,
Japan,... I'll tell you. The
subject of O-Ren's blood and
nationality came up before the
council only once. The night O-Ren
assumed power over the crime
council.

Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the
alcohol-fueled frivolity.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
The man who seems bound and
determined to break the mood is
Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...

Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the
plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces.

The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the
Tanaka Crime Family.

CRIME FAMILY LEADER #2 (JAPANESE)
Tanaka? What's the meaning of this
outburst? This is a time for
celebration.

BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
And what exactly should I be
celebrating? The perversion of our
illustrious council?

The Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains
cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it
for the rest of the sentence.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously
has something on his mind. Allow
him to express it.

BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
My father...
(looking at a clan head)
...along with yours and...
(looking at another)
...along With yours, started this
council. And while you drink like
fish and laugh like donkeys, they
weep in the afterlife over the
perversion committed today.

The BOSSES react again...O-Ren;

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Silence!
(then composed)
Of what perversion do you speak,
Tanaka?

Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says;

BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the
perversion done to this council,
which I love more than my own
children,...by making a half
Chinese American its leader.

Then...

Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,...

O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed...

Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body...

The head hits the floor...

And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of
blood shoots up in the air.

The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more
flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse.

The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to
their swords and draw them.

O-Ren turns her blade in their direction.

The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch.

The lady looks across at the two men and says in and
authoritative voice;

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Fight me or work for me.

They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Drop them on the ground.

They do.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Get behind me.

They do.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Get on your knees.

They do.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Put your foreheads on the floor.

They do.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Keep your mouths shut.

You better believe they do.

The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her.

As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for
their bosses.

O-REN
I'm going to say this in English so
you know how serious I am. As your
leader, I encourage you to -- from
time to time and always in a
respectful manner, and with the
complete knowledge that my decision
is final -- to question my logic.
If you're unconvinced a particular
plan of action I've decided is the
wisest, tell me so. But allow me to
convince you. And I will promise
you, right here and now, no subject
will be taboo...except the subject
that was just under discussion.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
(to a bodyguard)
Hand me that head.

He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen.

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.

O-REN (ENGLISH)
The price you pay for bringing up
either my Chinese or my American
heritage as a negative is, I
collect your fuckin head.
(now completely American)
Just like this fucker here. Now if
any of you sonsabitches got
anything else to say, now's the
fuckin time.

Nobody says anything.

O-REN (ENGLISH)
I didn't think so.
(pause)
Meeting adjourned.

EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT

The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The
CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant
staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on
their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not
satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The
door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps
inside, the door is slid shut.

INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT

The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The
patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA
CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII.

Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than
O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are
dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid
skirts and matching blazers.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)

On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL

The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,
white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,
are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88."

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move
blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.

And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans
Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.

They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a
joke in Japanese.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
The mop tops in black suits and
Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,
"The Crazy 88." The two young girls
in the schoolgirl uniforms are her
personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go
Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady
who's dressed like she's a villain
on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend
and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And
finally, the American in the black
suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's
head of security, Mr. Barrel.

SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,
her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's
listening to The Bride's narration.

The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --

O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe
and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono
on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.
The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost
taking off the tip of her nose in the process.

INSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.

O-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a
halt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to
retrieve the eavesdropper.

INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki
and Go Go step into the corridor.

All trace of the Bride has vanished.

They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.

Whoever was there is gone now.

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the
Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING
the door behind them.

ONE SHOT

CU The BRIDE
at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She
observes all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.
When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off
her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the
parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.
Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece
yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,
like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death." She tosses
the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo
sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her
back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren
dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open
the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to
the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki
leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the
bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce
Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.

END OF SHOT
BACK AND FORTH
between CU's of the two women, face to face.

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
(to Bride)
Can I help you?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Yes, I am looking for the attorney
of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would
that be you?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How
can I help you?

The Bride PUNCHES her in the face.

INT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM

Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the
Tokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private
army doing when we cut back?

Singing karaoke, of course.

It's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale
of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in
Japanese....

WHEN...

A COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and
the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper
wall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;

THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)
O-Ren Ishii! You and I have
unfinished business!

The Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.

They see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle
of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand
gripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.
Before anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything
...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.

O-REN'S
reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned
out to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's
BLEEPED OUT.

The Bride
The VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on
her forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS
ZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren
beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS
SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM
BACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS
PLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of
The Bride loaded for bear.

She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the
Shoulder with one stroke.

SOFIE
Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in
agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes
of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both
surprise and shock.

The CRAZY 88
run out into the dining area and create a human wall between
themselves and their Mistress.

MR. BARREL AND GO GO
take positions on either side of O-Ren.

O-REN
seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
You bastard!

The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's
blood flies off the blade.

The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two
warring parties.

The Bride
vs.
The Crazy 88

The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in
fear.

O-Ren says loudly to the room;

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid
we're going to have to close the
place. There's some private
business that we must attend to
now.

The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.

The Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold their ground without
moving a muscle, till the dining room, as well as the entire
restaurant known as "The House of Blue Leaves," is deserted
of every human not engaged in the face-off that precedes
combat.

O-Ren gives a simple order;

O-REN
Miki.

MIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,
unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.

MIKI (JAPANESE)
You had it coming bastard!

Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A
Banzai Scream...

The Bride turns to face him.

Miki Charging and Screaming...

The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking
Position.

Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.

The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to
arrive.

Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings...

The Bride Swings...

The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki
looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.

The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then
Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.

Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end
of a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in
the B.G.

O-Ren and her crew watch stunned.

The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that
starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge
blue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -
Red blood - Dead man.

The BRIDE
looks up from the pond, across the length of the floor, into
the eyes of O-Ren Ishii.
She takes one step forward, hears the slightest noise, Twirls
the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one knee, and
thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-covered
floor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...

The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...

OVERHEAD SHOT
Looking down on The Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew
at the other. A Red Circle appears where the blade is buried
in the floor...The red circle grows larger...and larger...and
larger...and larger still...

Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking
straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,
and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo
underworld.

O-Ren
her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Tear the bitch apart!

The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same
time with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.

They circle the Bride.

The BRIDE
Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips
the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in
front of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.

Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see
reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.

The six Crazy 88 Attack...

The BRIDE
does a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.

Four boys die an immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,
SCREAMING GRUNT, TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS
SLASHED IN, RED BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING
COLLAPSE TO THE FLOOR.

The last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is
SLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES
THROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.

EX CU The EYES
of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,

...BEAT

...they Look back up at O-Ren.

O-REN
standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.

The BRIDE
swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead
attackers flies off.

GO GO and MR. BARREL
unsheath their swords.

WHEN...

We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then
behind her, through the broken pictures window we see
seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the
riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry
samurai swords.

The BRIDE
looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.

O-REN
smiles.

O-REN (ENGLISH)
(to the Bride)
You didn't think it was going to be
that easy, did you?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
(to O-Ren)
You know, for a second there, yeah
I did.

O-Ren smiles...

O-REN (ENGLISH)
Silly rabbit...

Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...

O-REN/THE BRIDE
...Trix Are for kids.

This is something they used to say back when they fought
alongside of each other as "Vipers."

The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the
restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.

As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE
SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western
Stand-off.

We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround
the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one
JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE
IRON over his head.

As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of
The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword
Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...

....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...

...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN
TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE
ON SCREEN.

As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms
flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde
hair whipping like a whirling dervish....
...She's a Goddess of War Venus.

Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The
Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.

This explosion of furious violence is punctuated
CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the
fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning
the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO
OIL BLACK.

Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and
liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's
blade.

Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS

While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang
out of its holster, and Throws it...

....It Twirls Through the Air...

...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.

The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an
Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's
Out.

The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over
her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,
Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.

She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the
vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from
its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.

While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.
Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends
It Flying in the Charging Man's path...

...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...

...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he
falls flat.

The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks
her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.

...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands
off.

So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine
foot tall Bride fights with the others.

When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's
perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the
Bride back to the floor like an alevator.

As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,
somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an
attacker's legs into his groin.

He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.

ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He
Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,
"Come get a piece."

The Bride does a screaming charge towards him....
...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -
steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to
collide.....They meet.....

SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -
CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -

They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a
mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither
clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.

...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the
floor.

The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of
his chest.

Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain
alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still
holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,
backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining
killers.

Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the
action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from
his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and
Crashes to the floor.

The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself
for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy
Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.
She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and
feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped
over on its shell....

Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.

...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of
her head, and Pops back up on her feet.

And then there were seven.

The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved
out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the
floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.

The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,
lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In
repose.

EX CU The Bride's eyes
pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE
FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.

O-REN
WHIPS OPEN a red fan.

GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the
switch.

The room goes dark.

The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still
on the floor....

...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she
breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED
OVER HER FACE.

Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in
(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....

The Bride rises to her feet...

The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a
circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in
rhythm with the Metal...

The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both
Music and The Bride Explode!

WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE
With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers
fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow
falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like
black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.

The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue
backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and
death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all
sword-weilding partners.

She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They
seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then
CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or
hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each
encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride
crouches down low in repose while the others continue to
circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.

We Cut in closer whenever we need to.

Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's
sword.

GO GO
Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the
lights back on. The electricity shines light on...

The BRIDE
Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls
and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded
men who have yet to die, litter the ground.

With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's
subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.

Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives. Take them with
you. But leave the limbs you've
lost. They belong to me now.

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.

The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last
remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren
Ishii.

Go Go
steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai
sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.
She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a
WHOOSH sound in the air.

BALL AND CHAIN
in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.

The BRIDE
ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk
of wood post behind her.

Go Go
eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she
lets fly...

The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo
sword...

...Go Go yanks...

...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.

GO GO
smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

The BRIDE
removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.

The BOOMERANG
TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.

BAM

The young bodyguard swats it out of the air with her ball and
chain. She lifts up her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on
the floor. She looks across at her opponent...WHOOSH...
WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the
chest, knocking her on her back...

...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the
Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal
ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.

The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its
purpose.

She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.

Go Go hops up on a table...

As they fight they hop from table to table...

Go Go throws her ball and chain...

...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...

BATS it away with the table leg.

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around
the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...

...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL
CRASHING through another table.

Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai
short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.

The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly
with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to
the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams
as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she
rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the
table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER
HEAD.

The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and
delivers a powerful "C.K." to the Bride from below, dropping
her to her knees.

O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and
begins to strangle.

The chain digs into the Bride's throat.

The Bride brings the table leg, which has a couple of nasty
looking nails in it, hard against the Japanese girl's thigh.
The nails cut through the plaid school uniform skirt into her
flesh...the Bride rips out the nails, taking some leg meat
with them.

Go Go lets out a horrific scream.

The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young
girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe
becomes stained with red.

Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the
floor.

The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins
breathing air into her lungs.

Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...

The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's
weapon above her head.

Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second
floor...

The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the
ball and chain over her head.

Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...
She gets to the top.

The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...

It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari
sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.

CU GO GO
We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind
it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit
shatter like a teapot.

Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the
staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before
the tumble began.

The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go
to the last two remaining combatants...

...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Any more subordinates for me to
kill, O-Ren?

Mr. Barrel says;

MR. BARREL
One last one.

THE BRIDE
You're Mr. Barrel, right?

MR. BARREL
And you're Black Mamba.

THE BRIDE
Our reputations precede us.

MR. BARREL
Apparently.

THE BRIDE
Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don't you
wear your Kato mask? Are you and
iconoclast?

Mr. Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th
Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes.

MR. BARREL
I don't like that rubber band. It
fucks up my hair.

THE BRIDE
You shouldn't work for her.

MR. BARREL
Too late.

THE BRIDE
It's not too late to quit.

MR. BARREL
Do you have choices?

THE BRIDE
No.

MR. BARREL
I know exactly how you feel.

THE BRIDE
This has nothing to do with You and
I, and everything to do with me
taking satisfaction from that bitch
behind you. And there's absolutely
positively no way I'M going to
leave here without taking that
satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you
have to stand aside. And that means
you must quit, right now.

MR. BARREL
I can't.

THE BRIDE
Yes you can.

MR. BARREL
No I can't.

THE BRIDE
Don't say "Can't", there are no
"Cant's." Yes - You - Can.....

O-REN ISHII
Screams at her "...last line of defense;"

O-REN (ENGLISH)
What are you waiting for? Are you
on a date? Attack her you fool!

THE BRIDE
Oh my God...
(pause)
...She just called you a fool. She
just called you a fool in front of
me. Not only am I your opponent.
I'm a female fellow countryman.
And you're going to risk your life -
to say nothing of harming me - for
a woman who refers to you as a
fool?

O-REN
is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Attack, Goddamn you!

The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she
just saw.

Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look
she's never seen from him before.

He then looks back to the Bride.

Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the
slightest hint of plea in her voice;

THE BRIDE
I'll owe ya one.

He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his
sword;

MR. BARREL
The things I do for a pretty face.

INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The
Handle locks into place with a Click.

He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and
says;

MR. BARREL (JAPANESE)
I quit.

O-Ren fries and egg on her head.

Then with his sheathed Sword in his right hand, and his left
hand in his pants pocket, he walks across the carnage-strewn
room and out the front door. As he walks, when he's parallel
with the Bride, He stops and says;

MR. BARREL
About that one you owe me.

THE BRIDE
Yes?

MR. BARREL
I'm gonna collect someday, you
know?

THE BRIDE
I'll be disappointed if you don't.

He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the
restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's
lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says;

MR. BARREL
Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.

He exits the Movie.

O-REN and The BRIDE
match eyes. The Japanese gal says;

O-REN (ENGLISH)
Very funny.
(pause)
Your instrument is quite
impressive.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Domo.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Where was it made?

THE BRIDE
Okinawa.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Whom in Okinawa made you this
steel?

THE BRIDE
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
YOU LIE!!

The Bride just smiles at her rival's response.

O-Ren's composure returns.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Swords however never get tired. I
hope you've saved your energy. If
you haven't, you might not last
five minutes.
(pause)
Have you seen the garden in this
establishment?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
No.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Oh, you really should. It's quite
beautiful. Allow me.

O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire
battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the
same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white
paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING....

.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky.
A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow
falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but
Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the
doorway looking out into the white night.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
As last looks go, you could do
worse.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside...

The Bride follows her...

INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT

As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance
from one another.

COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish
Flamenco Guitar.......

The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in
front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle
and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her
cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls
around her.

O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises
up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face
vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls
around her.

O-REN'S FEET
White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow
underneath them...

The BRIDE
Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers
Crunching snow underneath them...

O-REN
when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat
artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in
one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....

....The Two Women circle each other....

They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING -
CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...

O-REN LEAPS in the air
does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her
opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing...

SLASHING The BRIDE
across her back - Spinning her around...

O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The
Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together
as the Blades become entangled...

O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that
loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into
The Bride's mouth...

Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on
her ass in a koi pond.

- The Combat Guitar Stops -

O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs;

O-REN (ENGLISH)
Silly Caucasian girl likes to play
with samurai swords. Bill might of
humored you, but you will find
neither humor nor mercy at my
blade. Now unless you intend to
commit sepeku among the koi, stand
up and fight. You may not be able
to fight like a samurai, but you
can at least die like a samurai.

The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises
out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly
to O-Ren in Japanese;

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Attack me. With everything you
have.

The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with
The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They
separate...

...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like
two locomotives...

O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The
respect for the Bride's ability is transparent.

The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again...

Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers...

Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down
legs staining White Socks with Red...

They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl
with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist -
Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off.

Both Women are out of breath and have to stop to recuperate.
As they both drink the harsh cold air into their lungs,
leaving red blood stains in the white snow, the two females
have the same thought. The next clash will be their last.

O-REN (JAPANESE)
I apologize for ridiculing you
earlier.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Accepted.

They continue breathing...

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Ready?

O-REN (JAPANESE)
Yes.

The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle
each other for their final attack.

With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash
in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find
themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall...

...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through
the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing
to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their
Samurai hearts out...

UNTIL...

They both SWING...

...can't tell who got who...

A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in
the white snow.

CU O-REN ISHII
facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see
she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN
is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops.
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just
ended with one swing, stares off into space.

O-REN (ENGLISH)
That really was a Hattori Hanzo
sword...

Her sword FALLS from her grip...in the snow by her feet.

O-REN (ENGLISH)
I always dreamed of owning one...

O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward.

Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says;

O-REN (ENGLISH)
Did he make it for you?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Yes.

The Last thing she says before she dies;

O-REN (ENGLISH)
...He must of liked you.

With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and
she's gone.

The BRIDE
removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing
earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the
blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list,
off her Hanzo Steel.

EX CU THE HANZO SWORD
is returned back to its sheath. The LION'S HEAD that Hanzo
carved into the wood seems pleased.

CUT TO:

The BRIDE
now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her
head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.

SOFIE FATALE
Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.

The BRIDE slams the trunk, SCREEN BOES BLACK...

The MAZDA driving down the road at supersonic speed.

The BRIDE
behind the wheel wearing her crash helmet. It looks like an
insert from "GRAND PRIX."

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD
car speeding...then stopping.

BLACK SCREEN
The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the
TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly
Viper syringe in her hand.

When she speaks it comes out of a VOICE BOX at the bottom of
the helmet. Turning her voice deeper and electronically
spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I've kept you alive for one reason.
Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer,
I take it you're familiar with
Bill?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Yes.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
In fact, I'd guesstimate, you
worked for Bill before O-Ren, and
that's how it is you came to work
for O-Ren. Am I correct?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Yes.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I thought so. Give me the arm you
have left.

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Why?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I want information. Now gimme your
arm.

Sofie offers up her remaining arm.

She injects Sofie with the gold syringe.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
The cocktail racing through your
bloodstream at this moment is
Bill's own recipe. He calls it "The
Undisputed Truth."

Sofie is injected.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Okay, first things first. Where was
the other Yubari sister? Yuki?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Yuki's sick. She went home early.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Do tell? What's wrong with her?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
She has a cold.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Awwww poor baby. What do you think
she'll do when she finds out what
happened?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
She'll wail with grief.

SHOCK CUT TO

YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death...

She SCREAMS!

BACK TO SOFIE

SOFIE
She'll drink excessively.

BACK TO YUKI
Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up.

BACK TO SOFIE

SOFIE
She'll start trouble.

BACK TO YUKI
sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in
a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the
make on her.

BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
Do you like Ferraris?

Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice;

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Ferrari...Italian trash.

She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the
business suit.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Do you find me hot?

The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she
gets annoyed;

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck
me, yes or no?

BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
Yes.

THEN...

He lets out a GRUNT coming from below.

We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short
sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen,
creating a big red grin across his mid-section.

TWO SHOT YUKI AND BUSINESS SUIT
Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated...She opens him up
more...he feels every inch of the blade's progress.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
How bout now, big boy, do you still
wish to penetrate me...

Blade cuts deeper...

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Or is it I who has penetrated you.

And with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice
that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor.

BACK TO SOFIE

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
When she stops shedding tears,
she'll start shedding blood.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Best guess, what will she do?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
I don't hafta guess, she'll come
after you.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Will she ever give up?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
She won't have to. When she finds
you, I don't know who will win. But
what I do know is, she will find
you.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Is she more skilled than I?

SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Skilled won't be the word.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Don't be coy with me, bitch. What
would be the word?

SOFIE
Crazy.

The Bride takes this in...then moves on.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Okay, now I want all the
information on the Deadly
Vipers,... What they've been doing
and where I can find them.

EXT. TOKYO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the
highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side.

The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the
trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the
hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the
huge hospital.

CUT TO:

CU SOFIE
in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF
SCREEN;

BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so
sorry.

SOFIE (ENGLISH)
Please forgive my betrayal --

He shhhh's her off screen;

BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
-- no more of that. I invented that
truth serum. Once it entered your
bloodstream, you no longer had a
choice.

SOFIE (ENGLISH)
But, still --

BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
-- But still -- nothing, except my
aching heart over what she's done
to my beautiful and brilliant
Sofie.
(pause)
If you had to guess why she left
you alive, what would be your
guess?

SOFIE (ENGLISH)
Guessing won't be necessary. She
informed me.

BACK TO THE BRIDE AT THE TRUNK

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I'm allowing you to keep your
wicked life for one reason and one
reason only. So you can tell him,
in person, everything that happened
here tonight. I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy..., by
witnessing your deformed body. I
want you to tell him, all the
information you just told me. I
want him to know what I know. I
want him to know I want him to
know.

Then with SUPERMAN X-RAY VISION we see through the helmet to
the Bride's face inside as she says the last line.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
And I want them all to know,
they'll all soon be as dead as O
REN.

WE CUT TO A 

CU of SOFIE
WE PAN to a CU of YUKI

Bill says off screen;

BILL (O.S.; JAPANESE)
If O-Ren was number one, unless
she's being tricky, Vernita Green
will be number two.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Where is Vernita Green?

BILL (O.S., JAPANESE)
Los Angeles. Vernita's in Pasadena.
But the woman you want will hold up
in a low budget motel, fifteen of
twenty minutes away from stepping
on board a plane departing LAX. If
I had to bet...I'd say Hawthorne.

Yuki blows a pink bubble gum bubble, it pops and she says in
English;

YUKI (ENGLISH)
California, here I come.

CUT TO:

CU HATTORI HANZO
He's sewing something that requires a lot of concentration.

CU The BRIDE'S BARE BACK
What he's sewing is, the NASTY SLASH O-Ren gave the Bride on
her back, closed with a simple needle and thread.

CU The BRIDE
lies naked on her stomach, head up, chin resting on her
folded hand, feeling no pain at the needle piercing her
flesh. The sleeping giant is awake, and in her eyes we see
she's filled with a terrible resolve.

As Hanzo sews, he recites in Japanese the Yagu mantra, the
Bride recites in Japanese after him.

EX CU: O-REN ISHII'S name written in the Bride's notebook
with the number one next to it. A black felt pen comes into
frame and draws a line through the name.

FADE TO BLACK.

FULL SCREEN

We stay with Yuki's side as she stops across the street from
the Bride. During their face-off we only see the Bride at a
distance.

The Bride is in the b.g., back to us packing her trunk, just
about ready to make a clean getaway...

WHEN...

Yuki yells to the figure across the street.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Conigute wa!

We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze
upon hearing the Japanese greeting. Without turning around
she says;

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Conigute wa.
(pause)
Yuki?

YUKI (ENGLISH)
Bingo!

THRILLER MUSIC begins on the soundtrack.

The Bride turns around to face the young avenger.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Can I help you?

YUKI (JAPANESE)
You can kill yourself.

Yuki giggles.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Taking a trip?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I was.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
You still are. One way.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I know you feel you must avenge
your sister. But I beg you...walk
away.

Yuki giggles.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
You call that begging? You can beg
better than that.

Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches
on the beam.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Can I see your face? I've heard
your beauty is exquisite. I would
like to see for myself.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Sure.

Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face
is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.

THE BRIDE
Domo.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Your face is so pretty, I just want
to put both of my palms against
your cheeks and give you little
tiny kisses.

Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
How do I look?

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Very pretty.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
You're just saying that 'cause I
told you how pretty you are.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Yuki, you're gorgeous.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Really? Is that how you'd describe
me to somebody if I wasn't here?
Yuki's gorgeous?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
You bet.

Yuki giggles.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Don't make me kill you.

YUKI (ENGLISH)
Okay.

Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back
and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.

The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy
wagon is demolished by the ammo.

The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her
backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of
front lawns...

Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...

The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.

Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the
hedge...

The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and
rolls under a Volkswagen van.

Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on
the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns
fire from behind the van.

Yuki yells to her in English;

YUKI (ENGLISH)
You think you're safe! I say; Ha!

She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,
and slides it towards the Bride.

The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on
the asphalt towards her...

She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND
HER.

She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING
OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the
fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other
house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride
swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow
end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front
of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.

WHEN...

Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.

Both women see the other.

Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of
her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.

The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on
the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and
automobiles.

When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...

She jerks the wheel...

SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite
direction.

SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...

SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...

BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.

In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.

Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.

She gets ready to make a third pass.

Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their
front door.

The Bride yells at them;

THE BRIDE
Stay in your house and stay down on
the floor!

Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and
drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for
her.

The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.

She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back
door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is
hiding and they block the door.

Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands
up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and
says;

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Time for the rabbit to come out of
her hole!

She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself
face down on the lawn.

The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.

Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride
runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and
runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.

Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...

The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just
about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...

WHEN...

Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.

The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of
the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --
blood pours out of her gunshots.

Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up
the house.

The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.

Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the
hallway.

The Bride fires...

The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking
her through a bedroom doorway.

THE BRIDE
(to herself)
Gotcha!

Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from
the doorway into the hallway;

YUKI (JAPANESE)
You fucking bitch! You shot me in
my breast! They're not fully
developed yet, you fucking asshole!
Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!

The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's
giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
Piss me off!

She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up
everything around the Bride.

When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Yuki, in about two minutes there's
going to be an army of police here.
So if you're gonna kill me, now's
the time.

From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue
powder. It gives her energy.

THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)
So what's it gonna be bitch?

Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.

YUKI (JAPANESE)
That fucking does it!

Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the
Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.

The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.

The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.

Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.

Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at
Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off
her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.

Yuki's face, dead, eyes closed...then they pop up open...
Guess what...she's not dead. Though she's bloody and her
schoolgirl uniform is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her
head turns in the direction of the Bride...

The Bride sees this and can't believe it...

They lock eyes...

...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a
deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that
builds to a scream...

She charges up the steps at the Bride.

The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...

Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...

The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her
ankle holster.

Yuki chargin...

The Bride cocks back the hammer...

...Yuki charging, getting closer...

The Bride FIRES

Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but
she keeps charging...

The Bride fires again...

Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised
high...

The Bride FIRES

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

The Bride fires, but her gun jams...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...

They struggle for a moment...

...TILL...

...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the

THE BRIDE
Goddamn, what a wildcat.

INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT

The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a
name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone.

NURSE OWENS
Hello.

CU The Bride
on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number
written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone
number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in
a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't
see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood
planks. The moon shines into the structure.

THE BRIDE
Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens --

NURSE OWENS
Who is this.

THE BRIDE
You don't know me, but --

NURSE OWENS
-- And I don't want to neither. Now
I don't know how you got my number,
but you can just rip that shit up,
because --

THE BRIDE
-- I've been shot five times --

NURSE OWENS
-- Stop, I don't wanna hear no
more. I got problems of my own.

THE BRIDE
I'm dying.

NURSE OWENS
Then bitch, you better call
yourself a ambulance, cause I don't
do this shit no more.

THE BRIDE
I can't call an ambulance.

NURSE OWENS
-- No, you can call a ambulance,
you just don't want to. But if your
ass is really dying, you ain't got
no motherfuckin choice.

THE BRIDE
I do have a choice, and I'm
choosing to call you. If you refuse
to help me, I'll die. And that will
be your choice.

NURSE OWENS
Bitch, I don't even know you!

THE BRIDE
What do you need to know? I'm from
Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and
only you can help me.

Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse.

NURSE OWENS
Okay, where you at?

THE BRIDE
I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a
kids treehouse. It's a street
called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick
Avenue. There's a bunch of police
cars and firetrucks, about two
blocks away.

NURSE OWENS
Whatcha do, crawl two blocks?

THE BRIDE
If you can't walk, you better
crawl.

Nurse Owens likes that last line.

NURSE OWENS
You got you some money dontcha, or
am I doin this out of the goodness
of my heart?

THE BRIDE
You come and get me, today's pay
day.

NURSE OWENS
You ain't too far away. You gonna
bleed to death I get there in a
half a hour?

THE BRIDE
Probably.

NURSE OWENS
Okay, I'll be there in fifteen
minutes.

THE BRIDE
Is that Pacific Standard Time, or
C.P.T.?

NURSE OWENS
Just you better be there when I get
there, and you better be shot five
times, and your bony ass better be
on your last motherfuckin legs.

THE BRIDE
How do you know I have a bony ass?

NURSE OWENS
You sound like you have a bony ass.

The Nurse hangs up the phone.

INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens.

Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor.

THE BRIDE
Glad you made it.

NURSE OWENS
There's cops all over here, I had
to be cool. They tend to notice
things like Negroes sneaking around
people's backyards.

The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey.

THE BRIDE
What's that?

NURSE OWENS
This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't
got no anesthetic.
(refers to the bottle)
So git busy.

INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOT
The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the
nurse extracts the bullets.

The Bride screams.

The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams.

The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three
cigarette butts and other balls of lead.

The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior;

THE BRIDE
That fuckin smarts.

Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says;

NURSE OWENS
Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the
future, you should avoid them if
you can.

THE BRIDE
I'll keep that in mind. So, do I
have a future?

NURSE OWENS
You'll live to kill again.

THE BRIDE
Splendid.

She passes out.

FADE TO BLACK.

EX CU SLOT IN DOOR
is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side.

DOORMAN (O.S.)
Yes?

TWO EYES (O.S.)
I heard you had a game?

DOORMAN (O.S.)
Who are you?

TWO EYES (O.S.)
They call me Bill.

DOORMAN (O.S.)
Bill what?

BILL (O.S.)
That, no one ever calls me.

A FEMALE VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN says to the Doorman;

FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Open the door Alburt, let's see
what this Bill looks like.

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,
and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of
the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a
tux, waits for L.F.'s word.

L.F. O'BOYLE
Are you a policeman, Bill?

BILL
Not anymore?

L.F. laughs.

L.F.
Let him play, Alburt.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.

L.F.
(to the players)
We now return to the game already
in progress. The point is nine
gentlemen, nine is the point...

As Alburt frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five
other men all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai
swords (as is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his
hand Bill holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the
sword;

ALBURT
I'll take that.

BILL
You'll have to.

The two men stare...

L.F.
Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you
intend to start any shit with that
sword?

BILL
I give you my word of honor, I will
start nothing.

L.F.
Good enough for me.
(back to game)

ALBURT
Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred
dollar membership fee.

BILL
That's rather pricey.

ALBURT
You wanna play for free, go to
Vegas. You start now you'll be
there by sundown.

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull
to death. He peels off two hundred.

BILL
I think I'll stay here. I'm
thirsty.

ALBURT
That way.

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.

BILL
Beer.

BARTENDER
Twenty dollars.

BILL
Twenty dollars for a beer?

BARTENDER
High cost of living shooter. You
don't like it, go to Vegas. You can
get a prime rib dinner there for
3.95.

BILL
What am I going to do, I'm thirsty. 
(throws a 20 on the bar)
Pour the beer.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.

BILL
(pointing to the can)
I don't get that?

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;

BILL
Cheers.

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.

L.F.
Gentlemen, let's see if the new kid
in school wants to play right away.
(to Bill)
How bout it new kid, you wanna
handle my bones, or do you just
like to watch?

Dropping his money roll on the table...

BILL
I came to play.

Color L.F. impressed.

L.F.
Boys take a look at this man, he's
what Webster's calls, a gambler.
The dice belong to you , sir.

With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes
them and inspects them.

L.F.
I hope you're not implying
anything, friend?

BILL
(as he inspects dice)
I'm not implying anything.

Alburt starts to move from his position by the door.

ALBURT
That did it fuckhead, you're out
the door --

L.F. motions him back to his position.

The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the
table, trade quips.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.

BILL
You looked me over when I stood in
your doorway. I'm looking you over
as I step up to your table. If I
don't know, I don't throw.

L.F.
Are you satisfied?

BILL
More or less.

L.F.
I think we're getting into a
antagonistic relationship.

BILL
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were
trying to take my money, and I was
trying to take yours.

L.F.
It's just a game.

Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room
reacts.

BILL
If you're game, take my bet
sportsman.

L.F.
Covered.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then
throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the
money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up
his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;

BILL
Shoot it all.

The room reacts.

L.F.
Covered.

He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5...

L.F.
The point is five, gentlemen, five
is the point.

Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money...

BILL
Shoot it all.

L.F.
Covered.

He shoots again, he wins again...

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her
table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses
the green on the felt and says;

BILL
Shoot it all.

L.F.
Pretty lucky tonight, huh?

BILL
Play a game of luck long enough
you're bound to meet some lucky
people.

L.F.
You know we've never been properly
introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.

BILL
And I'm not interested.

L.F.
No, you're rude. Why so rude rude
boy, I'm only trying to be
friendly.

BILL
I didn't come here to make friends.
I came here to shoot a little crap.
But then your boy over there hits
me up for a two hundred dollar
privilege to play fee --

L.F.
-- That's a membership fee, good
for --

BILL
-- You and nobody else. You sell at
the bar a half can of warm piss, at
twenty bucks a shot. How much did
the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65?
You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just
too Goddamn greedy. You know what I
like to do when I meet greedy
people? Take every fuckin thing
they got. Leave em with nothing.

L.F.
So that's your game, you want to
teach me a lesson?

BILL
I wanna burn you down. When I'm
through with you, you won't have a
pot to piss, or a window to throw
it out of. You'll thumb a ride out
of L.A. wearing a barrel.

L.F.
I could always save myself this
horrible fate by not taking your
bet.

BILL
To be replaced by a different fate.
The embarrassing truth that you run
a gutless game. I won't forget it.
I'm sure these gentlemen won't
forget it. I'm sure they'll tell
people who won't forget it. And we
won't come back. If we don't come
back, you won't get our money.
Couple of weeks, you won't have a
game.

L.F.
You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And
the idea of taking everything
you've won away, and sending you
out the door with nothing but a red
face, is so appealing to me, that I
will take your bet. But.....not
with those dice.

BILL
Oooohhh, that's....

L.F.
The house's perogative and you know
it.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are
placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the
dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her
stick.

Bill looks down at them.

L.F.
Maybe you would like to change your
bet?

BILL
Yes I would.....Shoot it
all.....Against myself.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.

L.F.
What?

BILL
Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet.
I'm betting I don't make it.

From the door Alburt says;

ALBURT
You can't do that.

BILL
Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's
perogative, and she knows it.

L.F.
Covered.

He throws....

....................BOXCARS.

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he
just busted.

BILL
Can I use your phone?

L.F.
Sure it's next to the bed.

INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.

L.F.
Game's over, get out! Get the fuck
out! No more tonight, go home....

BILL
(into phone)
Vernita's dead? When?
(pause)
What about her family?
(pause)
Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone
completely apeshit. No idea where
she is?
(pause)
Okay that did it, we're going to
Texas and talk sense into Budd
before (BLEEP) makes him number
three.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.
All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys
remain.

BILL
We're going to have a talk about
this later.
(pause)
Well, I'm not exactly among friends
at the moment.
(pause...he laughs)
I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

He hangs up.

BILL
Got a nose problem?

L.F.
I said you could use my phone. I
didn't say I wouldn't listen.

BILL
This is true.

L.F.
You didn't burn me down you know?

BILL
Course not. First rule of any
house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY
comes in and wipes the place out
insurance.

L.F.
If there weren't losers it wouldn't
be a game.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket
pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;

BILL
I sincerely hope you mean that.

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for
the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,
the real game was just beginning.
Bill was on the job, and she was
the target. Now Bill was the
greatest assassin of the 20th
century. In fact the term HITMAN
was coined for him. And he rarely
performs actual assassinations
anymore. However every once in
awhile - to keep his hand in - he
does. Only he plays a game. He
doesn't start big trouble...he lets
them start it. If they do, they're
dead. If they don't, not only won't
he perform, he'll take the hit off
the market. It's kind of fun
watching people gamble when they
don't know they're gambling, isn't
it?

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;

L.F.
Get my money back. Don't kill him.
Chop off all his fingers.

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.

INT. HALLWAY HOTEL

The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to
see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the
end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His
mastery of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts
through the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,
is the most skilled, but he too falls under the master's
blade.

INT. HOTEL ROOM

L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the
front door.

She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for
that matter, to step through the doorway.

WHEN...

The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black
gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and
YANKS her out the window.

EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),
outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side
by her hair.

BILL
Do you know a Jessica?

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.

BILL
Well, she knows you.

He drops her......

............... SHE FALLS....

...................................SHE SPLATS.

Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her
fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

FADE TO BLACK.

Paula Schultz"

EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY

A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle
of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;

"The city of
Austin Texas."

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing Bill's brother, BUDD. Not the Slick
Willie Budd with the black suit and the silver-tipped black
cowboy boots we saw earlier at the wedding chapel massacre.
No, the Budd we see now is the Budd who climbed into a bottle
five years ago, got himself comfortable, and decided to live
there.

Bill, looking like a cool million, stands out in the dirt and
dust of Budd's lot of land, looking up at his brother in his
natural habitat. In the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging
in the passenger's seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;

BUDD
Great day in the morning. Brother
Bill livin up to his familia
obligation.

BILL
How ya doin' Budd?

BUDD
Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
mad rush of wild parties and
wealthy women.

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.

BUDD
Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
Viking bitch in the passenger seat?

BILL
It's Elle. Want to say hello?

BUDD
Never said "bye," can't seem to
think of a reason to say, "hi."

INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR
Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air
conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through
the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between
Elle and Budd.

BUDD
What'd ya wanna talk about?

BILL
Are you not going to invite me in?

BUDD
No.

BILL
May I ask why not?

BUDD
It stinks in there, that's why. Now
what's so important it requires a
reunion?

TIME CUT

The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits
in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.
Bill stands.

BUDD
You tryin to tell me she cut her
way through eighty-eight bodyguards
'fore she got to O-Ren?

BILL
No. There wasn't really eighty
eight of them, they just called
themselves The Crazy 88.

BUDD
Why.

BILL
I dunno, I guess they thought it
sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about
26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)
attacked. They all fell under her
Hanzo sword.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.

BUDD
She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

Bill nods his head, "yes."

BILL
She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.

BUDD
He made her one? Didn't he swear a
blood oath never to make another
sword?

BILL
It would appear he's broken it.

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;

BUDD
Them Japs know how to carry a
grudge don't they? Or is it just
you tend to bring that out in
people?

BILL
(pause)
I know this is a ridiculous
question before I ask, but you by
any chance haven't kept up with
your swordplay?

BUDD
Hell, I pawned that years ago.

BILL
You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?

BUDD
Yep.

The disrespect is pain.

BILL
It was priceless.

BUDD
Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso
I got me 250 Dollars for it.

BILL
Since it was a gift from me, why
didn't you offer me the chance to
buy it back?

BUDD
Because that would've required me
to acknowledge your existence.
Drunken bum though I may be, I
don't need booze that bad. But who
the hell gives a crap anyway. That
bitch ain't gittin no Bushido
points for killin a white trash
piece of shit like me with a
samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a
titty bar, Bill. If she wants to
fight me, all she gotta do is come
down to the Club, start some shit,
and we'll be in a a fight.

BILL
-- Budd, you need to listen to me.
I know we haven't spoken for quite
some time, and the last time we
spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But
you need to get over being mad at
me, and start becoming afraid of
Bea. Because she is coming, and
she's coming to kill you. And
unless you accept my assistance, I
have no doubt she will succeed.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

BILL
Can't we forget the past, and look
at the happy side of all this?

Budd chuckles.

BUDD
And what would that happy side be?

BILL
She's brought "the boys" back
together.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.

BUDD
I appreciate the concern on your
face, but there's a difference
'tween "the boys", time can't
erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I
don't Jew outta payin my
comeuppance. That woman deserves
her revenge. And we deserve to die.
But then again, so does she. So I
guess we'll just see now, won't we.

EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

The My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at. His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him, out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the front, and he climbs out of the automobile.

INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin
on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at
him as he walks by.

TED
You're late, Budd, this shit ain't
school, ya know.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,
passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.

STRIPPER
Hey, Budd.

BUDD
Hey, Lucky.

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to
him;

STRIPPER
Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at
it again. There's shitty water all
over the floor.

BUDD
I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.

EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.

INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage
explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and
oders a;

THE BRIDE 
Shiner.

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she
drinks the Texas brew...SHE....

...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his
head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on
the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through
the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd
sitting oblivious on his stool....

WHEN...

Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling
every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.

EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.

EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai
sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

THEN...

...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

THEN...

Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

THEN...

On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

THEN...

Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on
a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

SERGIO LEONE CU:
The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.

BUDD'S POV:
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.

BUDD
Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
like a bitch.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.

BUDD
You done got a double dose of rock
salt, right in the ole tit.
Now not havin tits as fine or as
big as yours, I can't even imagine
how bad that shit stings...

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.

BUDD
...But I don't wont to neather.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.

BUDD
Now I know when it comes to a rock
salt burn, you're feelin pretty
much like a expert bout now. But
truth be told, you ain't felt all
rock salt's got to offer till you
took a double dose in your
backside.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!

BUDD
That gentled ya down, didn't it?
Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
two barrels of rock salt dug deep
in their backyard.

THEN...

Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

THEN...

Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.

INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT

The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename
"California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout
with her COACH.

This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass.
With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the
sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm.

Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth.

ELLE
Bill?

BUDD
Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.

ELLE
....Budd?

BUDD
Bingo.

ELLE
And what do I owe this dubious
pleasure?

BUDD
I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't
never been caught.

This gets Elle's attention.

ELLE
Do you mean what I think you mean?

BUDD
If you think I mean I got 'er, you
thought right.

ELLE
Did you kill her?

BUDD
Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do
it easy enough. She's so gentle
right now, I could preform her coup
de grace with a rock.

ELLE
What are you waiting for, run outta
liquid courage.

BUDD
No. It's just...I ain't killed
nobody in a long Goddamn time. And
just 'tween you, me, and Jesus
Christ, kinda made me a promise I
wasn't gonna. Be that however it
is. Back when I did kill people...I
got paid for it. Just don't seem
right...turn amateur this time of
life.

We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange.

BUDD (O.S.)
Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my
hand right now.

We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The
Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword.

BUDD
A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo
sword. And I'm here to tell ya
Elle, that's what I call sharp.

ELLE
How much?

BUDD
Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's
priceless and all.

ELLE
I'll give you a hundred thousand
dollars for it.

BUDD
I'm sure you would. But I'll take,
one million.

ELLE
Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you
were such a capitalist. I thought
drunks like yourself were beyond
such monetary concerns?

BUDD
Well Elle, a million dollars buys a
whole lotta Jack.

ELLE
Why then are you selling it to a
hateful bitch like me, when you
know Bill would pay more?

BUDD
If I'm gonna drink myself to death,
...it won't be on Bill's dollar.
It's gonna be on yours.

ELLE
What's the terms?

BUDD
You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll
see you here tomorrow mornin. You
give me a million in foldin cash,
I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man. How's that
sound?

ELLE
Sounds like we got a deal. One
condition.

BUDD
What?

ELLE
You kill her tonight.
(pause)
And one more thing.

BUDD
You said one condition.

ELLE
It's a caveat to the same
condition.

BUDD
What?

ELLE
She must suffer to her last breath.

BUDD
That Elle darlin, I can pretty
damwell guarantee.

ELLE
Then I'll see you in the morning
millionaire.

CUT TO:

OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed
of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...

THEN...

She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

THEN...

We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...

TILL...

With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.

BUDD
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of
"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
"PAULA SCHULTZ."

Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;

BUDD (SPANISH)
Look at those eyes. This bitch is
furious. You grab her feet, I'll
get her head.
(ENGLISH)
Got anything to say?

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.

BUDD (SPANISH)
In America white women call this
the silent treatment.
(laughing)
And we let 'em think, we don't like
it.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.

BUDD
Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
this.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.

BUDD
Looky here bitch, this is a can of
mace. Now you're goin underground
tonight, and that's all there is to
it. But, when I bury ya, I was
gonna bury you with this.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.

BUDD
But if you're gonna act like a
horse's ass, I'll spray this whole
Goddamn can in your eyeballs. Then
you'll be blind, burnin, and buried
alive. So what's it gonna be
sister?

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.

BUDD
You may be stupid, but at least you
ain't bloody stupid.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...

WHEN...

...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

THEN...

...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

THEN...

...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.

INT. PINE BOX

Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between
the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more
lights is cut off...

TILL...

...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The
last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.

Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...

INT. PINE BOX

EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE
LIT by the flashlight beam...

BAM...

...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making
The Bride jump...

BAM...

...More dirt. She reacts again.

BAM...

The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with
each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming
more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside
the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She
SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the
lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She
starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin
clawing at the wood lid...

TILL...

They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

TILL...

She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming
the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;

THE BRIDE 
Help me.

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,
mentally sending the little girl she became, back to wherever
she came from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She
talks to herself.

THE BRIDE
Well, now that you've had a nice,
good cry, let's figure out how to
get out of here? You're breathing
like you just been fuckin. Calm
down...close your mouth, and start
breathing short breaths, through
your nose.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's a lot better. But you're
still too agitated. Can you hear
your heart? It's like I'm buried
alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off
that flashlight.

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
No! I can't turn off the light. Yes
you can. The darkness will have a
calming effect. Now turn off that
fucking light.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.

INT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT

Budd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car
radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings.

BUDD
(into phone)
Yellow?

INT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT

Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the
great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone.

ELLE
Didja do it?

BUDD
Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we
speak.

A smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back
against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly
parts her lips...and lets out a;

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

This is the face of satisfaction.

FADE TO BLACK.

BLACK FRAME
TITLE APPEARS:

Chapter eight

"The cruel tutelage
of Pai Mei"

FADE UP ON

EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY

We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:

"SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"

A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;

BILL (V.O.)
Once upon a time in China, some
believe around the year, one-double
knot-three.

As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as
the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI."

BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)
...head priest of The White Lotus
Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
road, contemplating whatever a man
with Pai Mei's infinite power would
contemplate -- Which is another way
of saying, who knows. When, a
Shaolin monk appeared on the road
traveling in the opposite
direction. As the monk and the
priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity, gave the
monk the slightest of nods. The
nod, was not returned. Was it the
intention of the Shaolin monk to
insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
fail to see the generous social
gesture?
The motives of the monk, remain,
unknown. What is known, were the
consequences. The next morning Pai
Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
and demanded that the temple's head
Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
repay the insult. The Abbot, at
first, tried to console Pai Mei,
only to find, Pai Mei was
inconsolable. So began, the
massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
all sixty of the monks inside, at
the fists of the White Lotus. And
so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
Technique.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
exploding heart technique?

BILL (V.O.)
Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
all of the martial arts. He hits
you with his fingertips, at ten
different pressure points on your
body. And then, he lets you walk
away. But once you've taken five
steps, your heart explodes inside
your body, and you fall to the
floor dead.

We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then
fall to the floor dead.

EXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY

Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through
the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.

THE BRIDE
Did he teach you that?

BILL
No. He teaches no one the ten-point
palm - exploding heart technique.
But he is Nietzsche's psalm
personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
kill you, he will make you
stronger. Now one of the things I
always liked about you, Kiddo, is
you appear wise beyond your years.
Then allow me to impart, a word to
the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
him - even for an instant - a
defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
And if you throw any American sass
his way, he will snap your back and
your neck like they were twigs, and
that will be the story of you.

EXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of
the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White
Lotus Mountain.

For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the
White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The
temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But
now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All
the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,
who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some
feared as a devil...neither was wrong.

A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill
leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.

BILL
He'll accept you as his student.

THE BRIDE
Caught him in a good mood, aye?

BILL
More like a sadistic one.

She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.

Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.

BILL
Just seeing those steps again makes
me ache. You're gonna have plenty
of fun carrying buckets of water up
and down that fucker.

THE BRIDE
Why did he accept me?

BILL
Because he's a very very very old
man. And like all rotten bastards,
when they get old, they become
lonely. Not that that has any
effect on their disposition. But
they do learn the value of company.

THE BRIDE
When will I see you again?

BILL
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the Seventies.

THE BRIDE
What?

BILL
Nothing. When he tells me you're
done.

THE BRIDE
When do you think that might be?

BILL
That my dearest, all depends on
you. Now remember, no backtalk, no
sarcasm.
Least not for the first year.
You're going to have to let him
warm up for you. He hates
Caucasians, despises Americans, and
has nothing but contempt for women,
so in your case, that may take a
little while. Adios.

ZOOM...

The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all
alone, somewhere in the middle of China.

She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps
to Pai Mei.

INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE

The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred
years ago, except now it's empty and dusty.

The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin
steps.

THE BRIDE
(yelling)
Hello!

Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.

PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;

PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
Up the stairs, yankee woman!

A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's
private chamber.

THE BRIDE
(to herself)
More stairs, Jesus Christ.

The still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back;

PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
If it is Christ you seek, turn back
now.

She climbs the wooden staircase.

INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER

PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a
sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting
area. The Bride enters the room.

She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting
area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her
head.

 From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken by The Bride,
or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be spoken in 
ENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever MANDARIN is
supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths as DUBBED
ENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky Flick.

THE BRIDE 
Teacher, I am unworthy to be your
student --

Pai Mei is still unseen.

PAI MEI'S VOICE 
Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't
understand a single word you say.
It causes my ears discomfort. You
are not to speak unless spoken to.
Do you understand Mandarin any
better than you speak it?

THE BRIDE 
I speak Japanese very well --

PAI MEI'S VOICE 
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese,
or Mongolian, for that matter. I
asked if you understand Mandarin?

THE BRIDE 
A little, I am still learning.

PAI MEI'S VOICE 
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you
can't understand me, I will
communicate with you like I would a
dog. When I yell, when I point,
When I beat you with my stick!

Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.

WE CUT TO PAI MEI
He's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,
Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing
White Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by
about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting
area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.

PAI MEI 
Bill is your master, is he not?

THE BRIDE 
Yes, he is.

PAI MEI 
Your master tells me you're not
entirely unschooled. What training
do you possess?

THE BRIDE 
I am proficient in a combination of
Tiger and Crane style. And I am
more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.

PAI MEI 
(he makes a SNORTING
SOUND)
The exquisite art of the samurai
sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so
called exquisite art, is only fit
for Japanese fat heads. You really
are a silly ass.

This brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.

PAI MEI 
Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!

She lowers her eyes.

THE BRIDE 
I'm sorry master --

PAI MEI 
-- Silence! I do not wish to hear
your unintelligible excuses.

Pause...

THEN...

Pai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white
beard...

PAI MEI 
Your anger amuses me. Do you
believe you are my match?

THE BRIDE 
No.

PAI MEI 
Are you aware I kill at will?

THE BRIDE 
Yes.

PAI MEI 
Is it your wish to die?

THE BRIDE 
No.

PAI MEI 
Then you must be stupid. Rise
stupid, and let me get a better
look at your ridiculous face.

She rises.

CU The BRIDE
through the scrim, eyes down.

Pai Mei laughs to himself again;

PAI MEI 
You breathe hard. The one hundred
steps robbed you of your wind. So
your stupidity is matched only by
your weakness. Is there anything
you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak
Japanese. I despise the Goddamn
Japs. I would of thought an
American would be immune to their
pompous posturing. Apparently I was
wrong. Go to that drawer.

The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the
drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged
weapon.

PAI MEI 
Remove the sword.

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.

Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,
parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.

PAI MEI 
Let's see how good you really are.
Try and land a blow. If you land a
single blow, I'll bow down and call
you master.

The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with
the sword.

He deftly moves out of the way.

The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,
with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.

Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of
Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out
of the sword's path.

He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;

PAI MEI 
Come now woman, can't you even hit
an old man?

She tries more...

PAI MEI 
Your ability really is quite poor.

He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an
open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.

Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.

PAI MEI 
Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought
cripples who posed more of a
challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!

She ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade
of her Sword.

The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe
it.

Pai Mei smiles at her and says;

PAI MEI 
From here you can get an excellent
view of my foot.

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the
face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD
WALL.

The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.

Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his
hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling
STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.

PAI MEI 
Give up? Or care to try again?

The BRIDE'S FACE
shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,
that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly
amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to
quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to
distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.

She takes the sword from him and tries again.

But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the
sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young
girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other
arm...Poised to cut it Off.

PAI MEI 
That blade's sharp. Careful not to
cut off your own arm.

...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own
throat....

...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...

...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's
edge is against her thigh...

PAI MEI 
If you can't fight any better than
that, what use do you have for a
leg?

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...

...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the
stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between
her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.

PAI MEI 
Now that really would be a shame.

He takes the sword from her grasp...

SWINGS once...

The BLADES's against her jugular.

He SWINGS twice...

The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.

He SWINGS a third time...

The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.

PAI MEI 
Your swordsmanship is amateur at
best.

He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the
blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on
the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls
to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.

PAI MEI 
I'm a hundred and fifty years old,
and you can't even make me break a
sweat.

He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.

PAI MEI 
Let's see your Tiger and Crane
style match my Eagles's Claw.

Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes.

Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal
style martial arts dance.

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;

PAI MEI 
...pathetic.....terrible...you
idiot, you should've landed that
blow...you call that crane?...
Enough, I grow bored.

With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her
wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in
the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He
could literally break her arm in half.

PAI MEI 
I asked you to show me what you
know, and you did. Not a goddamn
thing.

He TWISTS her wrist...

...The pain is excruciating.....

PAI MEI 
Like all yankee women, the only
thing you know how to do is order
in restaurants and spend a man's
money.

He TWISTS more...

She CRIES OUT.

PAI MEI 
Excruciating isn't it? I asked you
a question!

Through gritted teeth, she answers;

THE BRIDE 
Yes!

PAI MEI 
I could chop off your arm at will.
I think I shall.

He raises his other hand to chop off her arm.

The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH;

THE BRIDE
No please don't!

PAI MEI 
If you wish to speak romantic
languages, you've come to the wrong
place.

THE BRIDE  
Please don't cut my arm off!

PAI MEI 
It's my arm now. I can do with it
what I please. If you can stop me,
I suggest you try.

THE BRIDE 
I can't!

PAI MEI 
Because you're helpless?

THE BRIDE 
Yes!

PAI MEI 
Have you ever felt this before?

THE BRIDE 
No!

PAI MEI 
Compared to me you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't
you?

THE BRIDE 
Yes!!!

PAI MEI 
THAT'S THE BEGGING!

He lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm.

PAI MEI 
Is it your wish to learn how to
make others as helpless as you
were?

THE BRIDE 
Yes.

PAI MEI 
Can you cook?

THE BRIDE 
Yes.

PAI MEI 
I'll be the judge of that.
(pause)
Draw me a bath...your training will
begin tomorrow. That arm is still
mine. You may lose it yet.

TIME CUT

EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.

The Bride stands behind him, watching.

He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.

He turns to the new student;

PAI MEI 
Since your arm now belongs to me, I
want it strong. Can you do that?

THE BRIDE 
I can, but not that close.

PAI MEI 
Then you can't do it.

THE BRIDE 
I can put my hand through that at
six inches.

PAI MEI 
And you could shoot a man from a
rooftop with a scope-sight rifle,
if you so desired, but this is not
what I asked. What if your enemy is
three inches in front of you, what
do you do then? Curl into a ball?
Or do you put your fist through
him.

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.

PAI MEI 
Now begin.

The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....

INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Both Pai Mei and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei
concentrates on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.
She tries to eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her
fingers won't work. She puts down the sticks and takes a
scoop of rice with her fingers.

Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.

PAI MEI 
If you want to eat like a dog, I
will make you live and sleep like a
dog. Outside. If you want to live
and sleep like a human being, pick
up those sticks.

She does.

THE WOOD WALL

The Bride HITTING it.

She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall,
hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her.

PAI MEI 
It's the wood that should fear your
hand, not the other way around. No
wonder you can't do it, you
acquiesce to defeat before you even
begin.

He walks off in a huff.

EXT. PIT - DAY

Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).

PAI MEI 
In that pit, is a rat.

We see one lone rat in the huge pit.

PAI MEI 
In the sky, is a bird.

Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
up in the sky.

A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through
it.

PAI MEI 
You are to go into that pit, and
catch that rat, with your bare
hands. If you catch the rat, I will
deem you the victor, and tonight
you will dine on bird. But, if you
can't catch the rat by sundown,
I'll deem the victor the rat. And
because of the disgrace to my
student, I will be forced to kill
it. And then I will force you, to
consume his body. Because to be my
student, you must develop a taste
for victory.

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.

The BRIDE
Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu.

MORE wall....

At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.

Trying to catch the rat to no avail.

WHEN...

A golden arrow kills the rat.

She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.

She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)
and looks at her teacher.

She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to
her teacher.

THE BRIDE 
I acknowledge defeat at the paws of
this rat. However, I will not eat
this filthy vermin. What I will
do...
(she RIPS the rat open
like a pomegranate)
...is consume his victorious heart.
(she snatches the tiny
heart from the rodent's
carcass. Holding it
between her fingers.)
But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.

She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew.

Pai Mei looking down on her, says;

PAI MEI 
How does victory taste?

THE BRIDE 
Bitter.

We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an
affirmative NOD and GRUNT.

The BRIDE'S FIST
goes through the wall.

THE BRIDE
(to herself)
Wow!

INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY

Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he
hears a noise.

PAI MEI 
Woman, is that you who disturbs my
meditation?

She answers from outside the door;

THE BRIDE'S VOICE (O.S.)
Yes, teacher.

PAI MEI 
Enter.

She does, bowing to one knee.

PAI MEI 
What news do you find so worthy, as
to disrupt my bath?

THE BRIDE 
I did it teacher. I put my fist
through the wall.

TIME CUT

PAI MEI and the BRIDE
looking at the hole in the wall.

PAI MEI 
Very good. Would you care to
demonstrate?

She moves in front of the wall.....Takes her position...Her
right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position....
With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where
she'll strike....Like she's transferring her energy into the
wood...She removes her left hand...and...STRIKES!

She hits it HARD, but her fist doesn't go through.

Her eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no
expression.

THE BRIDE 
I think you watching is making me
nervous.

PAI MEI 
Not only that, it has you speaking
before you were spoken to. Try
again.

She does.

And when she does, she DOES it.

CU PAI MEI
he says in ENGLISH;

PAI MEI
Impressive.

She immediately goes down to her knees;

THE BRIDE 
Thank you teacher --

He just as immediately, lifts her back up.

PAI MEI 
You still fight better than you
speak. Finally, a woman who
understands what's important.

THEN...

He MOVES the wall one inch in front of her.

PAI MEI 
Begin again.

Then the old man leaves to finish his bath.

The blonde gal begins again....Fist against wood...no
effect....starting all over.

CUT TO:

BACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER

PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in
Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat
of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.

Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above
her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where
many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound
by a leather belt around her.

Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and
wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots
and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her
bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to
her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside
down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out.

Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her
wrists, till both hands are free.

She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin
lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her
nose, about three inches from her hand.

THEN...

AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins
to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her
left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy
to it...

...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....

...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.

With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

A crack in the lid...

AGAIN...

Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...

AGAIN...

More dirt...

AGAIN...

Even more dirt...

AGAIN...

THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...

THEN...

Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -
SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting
plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.

EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT

A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the
tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her
grave.

WHEN...

The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of
Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother
earth's womb.

Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she
rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's
air as if it were gulps of water.

DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle
on her body.

SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.

INT. DINER - NIGHT

A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG
SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,
when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's
big picture window that makes him look twice.

SODA JERK'S POV:
Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the
Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the
world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts
character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.

The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at
the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;

THE BRIDE
I'd like a glass of water.

FADE TO BLACK.

"ELLE and I"

CUT TO:

CU ELLE DRIVER
Behind the wheel of a hot black and gold Trans Am, driving
full out on top of the desert's surface. Spanish Rock coming
out of her powerful speakers.

EXT. DESERT BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the
car and the radio.

The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the
bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with
one Good Eye.

BUDD
Want some breakfast?

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY

Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle
sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd
stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as
he finishes telling the tale of last night.

ELLE
...So that's called a Texas
funeral?

BUDD
Yep.

ELLE
I got to give it to ya Budd, that's
a pretty fucked up way to die.
What's the name on the grave she's
buried under?

BUDD
Paula Schultz.

Budd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the name
Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside her
pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and sees
the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against the
T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.

ELLE
Can I look at the sword?

BUDD
That's my money in that black case,
isn't it?

ELLE
Sure is.

BUDD
Well then, it's your sword now.

The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the
Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.

She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.

ELLE
So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars
with breakfast margaritas.

BUDD
That's a Hanzo sword alright.

ELLE
Bill tells me you once had one of
your own.

Pause.

BUDD
Once.

ELLE
How does this one compare to that
one?

BUDD
If you're gonna compare a Hanzo
sword, you compare it to every
sword ever made -- wasn't made by
Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips
around this.

He hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp.

BUDD
So, which "R" you filled with?

ELLE
What?

BUDD
They say the number one killer of
old people is retirement. People
got'em a job to do, they tend to
live a little longer so they can do
it. I've always figured warriors
and their enemies share the same
relationship. So now you ain't
gonna hafta face your enemy on the
battlefield no more, which "R" are
you filled with, Relief or Regret?

ELLE
A little bit of both.

BUDD
Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a
little bit of both. But I know damn
well you feel one more than you
feel the other. The question was
which one?

Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;

ELLE
Regret.

BUDD
Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol'
girl. I never saw nobody buffalo
Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.
Bill useta think she was so damn
smart. I tried to tell him... Bill,
she's just smart for a blonde.

He looks over at Elle and grins.

Elle looks at him.

ELLE
Want your money?

She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.

He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.

Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are
inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all
this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.

BUDD
Great day in the morning.

He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then
another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks
down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

The Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT
BUDD...

...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession
(three times in the face, and once in the forearm).

Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles
of money fall with him.

Elle takes a sip of her Margarita.

The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator.

Elle looks down, Budd lies on his back on the kitchen floor
at her feet. His face is already grotesquely swollen and
white as a sheet. The serpent's extraordinarily potent venom
makes a full-frontal assault on the cowboys's nervous system.

ELLE
Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude
of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like
to introduce my friend, The Black
Mamba.
(gesturing towards the
refridgerator)
Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You
know before I picked up that little
fella, I looked him up on the
internet.
(she removes her notepad
from her pocket)
Fascinating creature the Black
Mamba. Listen to this,
(reading from the notepad)
"...In Africa, the saying goes, in
the bush, an elephant can kill you.
A leopard can kill you. And a Black
Mamba can kill you. But only with
the Mamba, and this has been true
in Africa since the dawn of time,
is death sure. Hence its handle;
Death Incarnate."
(looking up from the
paper)
Pretty cool, huh?
(back to paper)
"...Its neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,
acting on the nervous system
causing paralysis. The venom of a
Black Mamba can kill a human in
four hours, if say bitten on the
ankle or the thumb. However, a bite
to the face or torso can bring
death from paralysis within twenty
minutes.
(up from paper to Budd)
Now you should listen to this cause
this concerns you.
(reading from the paper)
The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bit can be
gargantuan.
(looks up from paper)
-- You know I've always liked that
word Gargantuan, and I so rarely
have an opportunity to use it in a
sentence.
(back to paper)
"If not treated quickly with anti
venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be
fatal to human beings. However, the
Black Mamba can deliver as much as
100 to 400 milligrams of venom from 
a single bite."

Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down
at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just
described.

ELLE
Now in these last agonizing minutes
of life you have left, let me
answer the question you asked
earlier, more thoroughly. When it
comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta
"R's" in me. Revenge is one.
Retribution is another. Rivalry is
definitely one. But I got another
"R" for that bitch you might be
surprised to find out. Respect. But
right at this moment, the biggest
"R" I feel, is Regret. Regret that
maybe the greatest warrior I have
ever met, met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky
piece of shit like you. The woman
deserved better.

Budd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her
cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on
the line, but we never hear their side.

ELLE
(into phone)
Bill...Elle. I have some tragic
news.
(pause)
Your brother's dead.
(pause)
I'm sorry baby.

Budd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places
her foot over his mouth.

ELLE (CONT'D)
She put a Black Mamba in his
camper.
(pause)
I got her, sweety.
(pause)
She's dead.
(pause)
Let me put it this way. If you ever
start feeling sentimental, go to
Austin, Texas. When you get here,
walk into a florist and buy a bunch
of flowers. Then you take those
flowers to Huntington cemetery on
Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the
headstone marked "Paula Schultz",
then lay them on the grave. Because
you will be standing at the final
resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.

Okay, I'm leaving now, go smoke

She hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man
under her shoe.

Picking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on
her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money.

CU The BLACK MAMBA
out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle...

Elle senses it. And slowly turns her head to look back..

Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver LOCK EYES...

ZOOM INTO BOTH CU's tighter and tighter, till Elle says;

ELLE
Bring it on, bitch.

The viper known as death incarnate, LEAPS at Elle.

Elle flicks her wrist slightly. She doesn't even swing the
blade. She just holds it.

The snake's head touches it, and is immediately SEPARATED
from its body.

ELLE'S EYES look down at the Japanese steel in her hand.

HANZO BLADE
a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel.

ELLE
Now that's what I call sharp.

EXT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black
suitcase in her hand.

She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the
engine, turns on the radio....

WHEN...

...she thinks she hears something...she looks out her
driver's side car door window...

ELLE'S POV:
The dirty BLONDE BRIDE behind the wheel of her new, enormous
red pickup truck, HEADING RIGHT FOR HER...

her jaw drops open. She's gobsmacked. Not only does she see
the dead walk, she sees the dead behind two tons of metal
coming at her at 100 MPH...

CRASH

The Red Pickup T-BONES the Trans Am, the gold and black car
FLIES through the air, then ROLLS OVER AND OVER about five
times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down.

The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of
the black and gold sports car. A smile with the slightest
hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face.

She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper.

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

As she walks through the door, Budd's dead, swollen body
greets her. As does her serpent namesake, dead on the floor
from decapitation.

She begins searching the camper, quickly, for something in
particular. We don't have the slightest clue what it could
be.

FLASH ON
EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE.

The BRIDE'S POV:
She watches from a high perch, Budd practicing with a ...
SAMURAI SWORD.

The BRIDE
searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor,
resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath. She removes
it from its hiding place.

WOOD SHEATH
Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo
sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English
words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from
Bill."

She closes the sheath, this will do. She sees a pair of
cowboy boots. Picks one up and places the sole of the boot
against the sole of her foot. Her feet and this man's boot
are around the same size. She slips her dirty feet in them.

She's good to go.

EXT. DESERT 

Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the
Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.

A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's
home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten
years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every
footfall creating a cloud of dust.

The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other
in showdown position.

A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.

ELLE
Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that
alacky had got the best of you.

THE BRIDE
You thought wrong.

The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.

Elle does the same.

ELLE
(referring to the sword)
What's that?

THE BRIDE
Budd's Hanzo sword.

ELLE
He said he pawned it.

THE BRIDE
Guess that makes him a liar, don't
it?

Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde
warriors circle each other.

THE BRIDE
(question)
Elle?

ELLE
(answer)
Bea.

THE BRIDE
I was wondering, just 'tween us
girls, what did you say to Pai Mei
for him to snatch out your eye?

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE

ELLE
I called him a bastard.

THE BRIDE
Oooh, not so good.

ELLE
Were I to do it over again, I'd
bite my tongue.

THE BRIDE
One more question?

ELLE
Shoot.

THE BRIDE
Where's Bill?

ELLE
Villa Quatro.

THE BRIDE
Gulf of Mexico?

Elle nods her head 'yes.'

THE BRIDE
You wouldn't lie to me now?

ELLE
Why lie?

Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.

The Bride raises up her sword.

THE BRIDE
I saw what you did to that little
Mamba in there. Want to try that on
somebody your own size?

ELLE
I intend to.

The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai
bearing.

THE BRIDE
Oh Elle, I should warn you before
we get started. Hattori Hanzo
swords are extremely sharp. They
can take a little getting used to.
Careful not to cut your own arm
off.

ELLE
I don't rattle, bitch!

The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.

THE BRIDE
You're gonna bleed though, you're
gonna bleed a lot.

THEN...

SPAGHETTI WESTERN MUSIC EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

The two blonde warriors....swords in position...no longer
circle each other....but instead move forward...closer and
closer to each other....one baby step at a time...

EX CU'S OF:

Their separate GRIPS on the SWORD'S HANDLE.

Their FEET moving closer.

The Bride's eye.

Elle's eye.

The Tips of each other's Blade.

As the Operatic Spaghetti Western Music Builds to a
crescendo...we CUT BACK AND FORTH between CU's of the two
women that get TIGHTER AND TIGHTER as we ZOOM in CLOSER and
CLOSER....UNTIL...We reach the THEME'S CLIMAX....

Both women let loose with a  Samurai Grunt and Swing.

EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH.

EX CU: BLONDE HAIR WHIPPING.

EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH AGAIN.

TWO SHOT: The TWO WOMEN WARRIORS stand their ground, STRIKING
and DEFENDING...When they stop, no one's been touched.

The TWO WOMEN - Swords in attack position - stare across to
the other one, as they prepare for their next attack...

Now they begin to circle again.

CU THEIR FEET making a circular walk.

They ATTACK...

EX CU BLADES MEET -- However this time we don't know who's on
the left or the right. One Blade maneuvers around the other.

EX EX CU: of TIP OF BLADE SLICING OPEN SKIN, about a quarter
of an inch. It looks like a scalpel cut. No blood. Just skin
separating. We don't know who's cut.

The TWO WOMEN stand and face each other. Neither knows if
it's them who has been struck. Neither woman bleeds.

We feel a count of...One Mississippi...

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE, clean as a whistle.

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its
TIP.

We feel a count of Two Mississippi...

ELLE,
BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's
neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit
the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an
aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle
feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the
spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a
balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the
spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.

Elle drops the Bride's sword.

As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each
other.

The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is
escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across
at each other, the two women see the other for the first
time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as
bitches...but as sisters.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls
to her knees in front of The Bride....

...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against
The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's
leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the
Bride's leg.

The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and
begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.

Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have
been theirs.

WIDE SHOT
The Bride standing, Elle on her knees, the desert surrounds
them.

The BRIDE

WIDE SHOT
The Bride has finished burying Elle. She sticks a jerry
rigged wood cross in the ground as a marker. Then using her

partaking of his current hobby......Flower Arranging.

With his hands among various flowers of BRIGHT COLORS, he
sorts and prunes a very pretty arrangement.

EX CU the BRIDE'S EYE
....watching....

Bill's Mexican housekeeper, JOSEPHINA, appears on the patio.

JOSEPHINA
Mr. Bill, you wanted me to tell you
to leave now.

BILL
(finishing up)
Yes, I got to go and meet the
Duchess.
(referring to the flowers)
Do you like it?

JOSEPHINA
Oh yes Mr. Bill, it's very pretty.

BILL
Why don't you put it on the dinner
table, so we can enjoy it tonight.

JOSEPHINA
(she takes it)
Good idea, she'll love it.

As he heads out the patio, he tells her;

BILL
Oh and Josephina, take the
remaining flowers and spread them
around the house, if you would.

JOSEPHINA
Yes, Mr. Bill.

He exits the patio, then turns around and pops his head back
in.

BILL
You know I just had a great idea.
Take the roses, and spread the
petals on the bed I just got for
her. That'd be a nice thing to come
home to, wouldn't it, a bed of
roses.

JOSEPHINA
Oh, she'll love that Mr. Bill.

BILL
You wouldn't mind doing that for
me, would you Josephina?

JOSEPHINA
No, not at all.

FLASH ON
EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
....watching....

We follow behind Bill as he moves through his house...He
slips on his jacket...Grabs his keys...TWO energetic GERMAN
SHEPHERDS follow him out the front door onto his driveway.

On his way to his silver Porsche, he roughhouse plays with
the dogs, speaking to them in Spanish. When he gets to the
sports-car, the dogs won't leave him alone, and one jumps on
the Porsche. He yells at it in Spanish;

BILL (SPANISH)
Get the fuck off the car, Lucy,
Lucy, down!

FLASH ON
EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
...watching...

The gates in front of Bill's Hacienda home open, and his
silver Porsche hits the streets running.

FLASH ON
EX CU The Bride
...watching...
A SUSPENSE THEME PLAYS OVER THE SHOTS of The Bride's Eye
every time we cut to it. Over the SHOTS OF BILL DRIVING we
hear a SPANISH TRAGIC LOVE BALLAD, coming from the car radio.

BILL
driving his convertible as the beach WHIZZES by in the
background.

The Bride's eye.

Dirt Road, lined by greener than green trees, the Porsche
kicks up dirt ZOOMING down it.

CU BILL
driving as the Spanish love song plays.

The Bride's eye.

A striking but antiseptic-looking INSTITUTION of some sort,
surrounded by the beautiful foliage of Mexico. Bill's silver
Porsche drives up its driveway.

The Bride's eye.

INT. INSTITUTION

The institution is not Spanish in style, but on the contrary
it's a clinical new-age box-like structure made up of clear
glass doors and walls and the color beige.

Bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone Asian FEMALE
RECEPTIONIST, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. In
JAPANESE he explains to her his reason for being there.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
...watching...we now leave any shot of Bill not from the
Bride's perspective. The SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER
and TIGHTER as we look through the Bride's POV and listen to
her VO;

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
The attentive audience members
among you will have probably
noticed, that all my kills have
been straight up fights.

The Bride's POV: The Glass-enclosed Institution, and Bill
standing by himself in the empty lobby.

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Y'all figured I'd face him with my
Hanzo sword, aye? Well, I figured
Bill figured the same thing. I am
the product of three godfathers.
Bill, Pai Mei, and Hattori Hanzo.
Different teachers teach you
different things. But one thing I
learned from all three, was "in
combat, the opponent that does the
unexpected, can usually expect to
be the victor." Bill would never
see this coming. Not from me. And
least any of you judge me a
bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill
who taught me how to shoot.

As the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen INSERTS of her
putting together her high-powered scope rifle. Snapping on
the scope sight. Setting the FOCUS through the CROSSHAIRS.
Loading the heavy-duty AMMO. Curling her long white finger
around the rifle's TRIGGER.

SCOPE SIGHT POV: Bill's head in between the Crosshairs.
SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER STILL...it will soon
break.

WIDE SHOT
looking through the Institution's glass wall. The elevator in
the lobby opens...and A LITTLE GIRL steps out, and runs into
Bill's arms. A LITTLE GIRL about five years old. A FIVE-YEAR
OLD LITTLE GIRL with blonde hair. Bill picks up the Little
Girl and lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE
SIGHT.

SUSPENSE THEME SNAPS into an OPERATIC WAIL...

EX CU: The Bride's finger, pops off the trigger.

EX CU: The Bride's eye, A HUGE TEAR FALLS OUT...We move out
of the eyeball, into a MEDIUM CU of The Bride, tears falling
down her face...She can't believe what she's looking
at...that's her daughter...She's alive...

Her REMEMBERING THEME PLAYS...

FLASH ON
The Bride remembering, while she was in her wide-eyed coma
state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND NURSES
performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is
passed to other hands above her wide-eyed unblinking
expressionless face.

CU of The BRIDE
In one moment, Bill has managed to suddenly change the game.

EXT. LONG LONG LONG EMPTY ROAD IN MEXICO - DAY

Silence, except for a few birds.

THEN...

WE HEAR the Roaring of an Engine, and the Silver Porsche
WHIZZES into FRAME.

INT. PORSCHE (MOVING) - DAY

Bill behind the wheel, his little girl asleep in the
passenger seat. He sees something ahead.

A convertible Volkswagen Karman Ghia enters the road heading
in the opposite direction. It's a long long long way off, but
it will get closer every second.

Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a
glance at his sleeping child.

His cell phone RINGS, he answers it.

BILL
Hola.

INT. THE BRIDE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long
blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to Bill for the first
time in five years and six months.

THE BRIDE 
Hello Bill.

BILL
Kiddo, is that really you?

THE BRIDE
Oh, it's me all right.

BILL
I hear you were driving a truck?

THE BRIDE
My pussy wagon died on me. Who's
your little friend?

He glances down at the sleeping child.

BILL
Oh, you mean the little tow head
next to me, who looks
extraordinarily like you?

THE BRIDE
Yeah, that one.

BILL
Her name is B.B.

The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice.

THE BRIDE
B.B.?

BILL
Yes. Do you approve?

She wipes her eyes. Her hand moves under her shirt,
fingertips rest on scar.

THE BRIDE
Yes. Can she hear us?

BILL
Not now, she's in dream land.

THE BRIDE
How old is she?

BILL
What do you mean by that?

THE BRIDE
How many years has she been alive?

BILL
Don't ask how old she is, ask, if
she's five.

THE BRIDE
Is she five?

BILL
Aren't mothers like God, aren't you
supposed to automatically know?

THE BRIDE
I did and I do.
(pause)
I want to meet her.

BILL
Have dinner with us at my hacienda
tonight. She's expecting you.

THE BRIDE
What do you mean?

BILL
I knew you were on your way, so I
told B.B. Her mommy was coming to
see her.

THE BRIDE
(confused)
What have you told her about me?

BILL
That you were sick, that you were
asleep, but one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been
asleep since I was born, how will
she know what I look like?" To
which I replied, "Because Mommy's
been dreaming of you." And she
said, "Then I'm gonna start
dreaming of her." So I gave her a
picture of you --

THE BRIDE
-- which one?

BILL
The one I took of you in Paris,
sitting on the steps with the
baguette in your hand. Since she
was one and a half years old, she's
slept with that picture of you next
to her bed.

The EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then
DISSOLVES AWAY.

THE BRIDE
You know, prettier photos of me do
exist.

BILL
And she's seen them. But the one
she wants looking after her while
she sleeps is the one of you
holding bread.
(pause)
We normally have dinner around
seven, is that convenient?

THE BRIDE
Yes.

Pause....The cars get closer...

THE BRIDE
When do we cross swords?

BILL
Well, it just so happens, my
hacienda comes with its very own
private beach. And my private
beach, just so happens to look
particularly beautiful bathed in
moonlight. And there just so
happens to be a full moon out
tonight. So, swordfighter, if you
want to sword fight, that's where I
suggest. But if you wanna be old
school about it - then we can wait
till dawn, and slice each other up
at sunrise, like a couple real life
honest to goodness samurais. As per
usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big
decisions up to you.

The cars will soon pass...

THE BRIDE
Do me a courtesy?

BILL
Anything.

THE BRIDE
Slow down as we pass...I want
another look at her.

BILL
Wear something nice tonight?

THE BRIDE
I have a dress all picked out.

BILL
Will I like it?

THE BRIDE
You said I looked beautiful last
time you saw me in it.

BILL
I'll dress up too.

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does
the same.

The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass.

The Bride looks into the other car.

We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.
We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill
holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our
face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.

The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the
driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.

The two cars pass each other.

The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks
in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing
the cell phone she screams in it;

THE BRIDE
You fucking maricone!

Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.

BILL
Now you just wait one second there
little missy. Unless I'm confused,
we are trying to kill each other
aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on
taking a shot at you in front of
the squirt, but, she is asleep. And
if you're gonna forget everything I
ever taught you, and gawk like you
ain't got good sense, I'm gonna
take a shot, am I not?

THE BRIDE
Did she wake up?

BILL
Of course not. She's like you that
way.
I look forward to this evening. It
was great speaking with you, Bea.

He hangs up.

INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT

Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat...

WHEN...

His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He
hurriedly answers it.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
(in phone; groggy)
Hello....

INT. MEXICO HOTEL - DAY

The Bride's on the phone, calling Japan, in tears.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Hattori!

HANZO (ENGLISH)
Beatrix, what's wrong?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
She's alive! My baby girl's alive!

CUT TO:

INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA

The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's
dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one
she was bushwhacked in.

Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her
earlier on the phone.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
Half of Bill's strength, lies in
his talent for the unexpected.
If you intend to vanquish this man,
and claim your daughter, you must
not only expect the unexpected. You
must do the unexpected.

WE DISSOLVE BACK to The Bride.

We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to
Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his
front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach
her.

Now comes the new stuff.

She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the
boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.

The two satellites freeze...

She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

ONE is BLOWN APART by the blast.

She SLIDES THE PUMP a second time...BLAST.

TWO buys the farm.

She slides the PUMP again...

...and BLASTS the front door, kicking it open and stepping
inside.

INT. BILL'S VILLA - NIGHT

ANOTHER BLACK-SUITED SATELLITE hurries down the stairs,
reaching for his weapon...

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...

He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.

She points the shotgun straight down at his face.

THE BRIDE
Hello Manny.

She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.

Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.
Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes
across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head
for parts unknown.

So far, so good.

She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook
and housekeeper, Josephina.

Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.

THE BRIDE
Hello Josephina.

JOSEPHINA
Hello Miss Beatrix.

She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen
pantry.

THE BRIDE
Stay in here and don't come out. If
you leave this room I'll shoot you,
comprende?

JOSEPHINA
Yes.

She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway
leading to the living room.

With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she
moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to
her from around the corner.

BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Kiddo! If you're through shooting
the servants, I'm in the living
room. You remember how to get to
the living room, don'tcha? Go down
to the end of the hall, and make a
left.

Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end.
She pumps the slide, and TURNS THE CORNER - SHOTGUN RAISED -
READY TO FIRE...

WHEN...

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES - blink once.

EX CU HER FINGER comes off the trigger.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a tuxedo,
holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her. Standing
next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed up in a
very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding a orange
squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.

The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;

BILL
(loudly)
Bang Bang!

Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been
shot.

BILL
Oh B.B., Mommy got us.

B.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside
her dad...Bill falls to the floor.

BILL
Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

B.B. parrots this.

B.B.
Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl;

BILL
Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot
you.

The little girl falls down pretend dead.

The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them,
is truly thrown.

Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying
breath;

BILL
You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You
are-the fastest.

And with these last words, pretends to die.

But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic
narrator's voice.

BILL
But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo
know,...that five-year-old B.B.
Gunn was only playing possum, due
to the fact she was impervious to
bullets.

B.B. raises her head off the floor and says;

B.B.
(to Mommy)
I'm impervious to bullets, Mommy.

BILL
(to B.B.)
Hey, get back down there, you're
playing possum.

The little girl's head drops back down.

Bill continues his dramatic narration;

BILL
So, as the smirking killer
approached, what she thought, was a
bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when
the little B.B. Gunn fired.

B.B. springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says;

B.B.
Bang bang!

The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery.

Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his
normal voice;

BILL
Mommy, you're dead - so die.

The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death
scene fo her little girl.

THE BRIDE
Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have
known, you are the best.

She falls to the floor and pretends to die.

The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl
in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy.

Mommy opens her eyes.

B.B.
Don't die Mommy, I was just
playing.

From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her
for the first time.

MOMMY
I know baby.

They embrace each other.

B.B.
I waited a long time for you to
wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me
- I dreamed of you?

The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins
to creep into her voice;

THE BRIDE
Every single night, baby.

She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better
look at her.

THE BRIDE
Now let me look at you. My my my...
What a pretty girl you are.

B.B.
You're pretty too, Mommy.

B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair.

THE BRIDE
Thank you.

All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor.

BILL
When I showed you Mommy's picture,
tell Mommy what you said.

The little girl gets shy.

BILL
C'mon shy girl, you know what you
said, tell Mommy, it'll make her
fell good.

As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says;

B.B.
I said - I said - You're the most
beautiful woman I ever saw in the
whole white world.

BILL
That's the truth. That's what she
said.

B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the
Bride's wedding gown.

B.B.
What's that?

MOMMY
Oh, Mommy spilled something on her
dress.

B.B.
Blood?

MOMMY
No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?

B.B.
No.

BILL
Do you not like it, or do you not
know what it is?

Parroting Bill;

B.B.
I do not know what it is.

MOMMY
Well, it's a very tasty beverage
that I used to drink, when I was a
little girl. It comes in a lot of
different flavors and colors, and
it's really good. Maybe we should
fix some sometime. Want to do that?

The little girl gives a big nod, yes.

BILL
Speaking of fixing and drinking and
eating, I think it's dinner time
don't you?

B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.

BILL
(to Mommy)
When you were doin all that fancy
shootin, you didn't happen to shoot
a nice Mexican woman about forty
five years old, did ya?

MOMMY
No.

BILL
(wiping imaginary sweat
off his brow)
Whew, then dinner should be done.
(shouting to the other
room)
Josephina! You can come out now,
we're ready for dinner.

JOSEPHINA (O.S.)
Yes, Mr. Bill.

He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then
says to B.B.;

BILL
Want to go on top of the world?

She says excitedly;

B.B.
Yeah!

He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and
as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through
the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The
Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of
their songs.

INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father
and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.

BILL
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide
world?

B.B.
Yes I do.

BILL
In fact it's better than pretty.
What's better than pretty?

B.B.
Gorgeous.

BILL
Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is
gorgeous.

The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill.

BILL
You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at
Daddy.

B.B.
Why? Where you a bad daddy?

BILL
I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad
daddy.
(to Mommy)
Our little girl learned about life
and death the other day.
(to B.B.)
You want to tell Mommy about what
happened to Emilio?

B.B.
I killed him. I didn't mean to, but
I stepped on him and he stopped
moving.

BILL
Emilio was her goldfish. She came
running into my room holding the
fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy
daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said,
"Really, that's so sad. How did he
die?" And what did you say?

B.B.
I stepped on him.

BILL
Actually young lady, the words you
so strategically used were, "I
accidentally stepped on him."
Right?

B.B.
Yeah.

BILL
To which I queried, "And just how
did your foot accidentally find its
way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And
she told me no no no, Emilio was on
the carpet when she stepped on him.
(beat)
Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And
just how did Emilio get on the
carpet? And Mommy, you would have
been real proud of her, because she
didn't lie. She said she took
Emilio out of his bowl, and put him
on the carpet. And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet, baby?

B.B.
He was -- flapping.

BILL
And then you stomped on him?

B.B.
Uh-huh.

BILL
And when you lifted your foot up,
what was Emilio doing then?

B.B.
Nothing.

BILL
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

B.B.
Uh-huh.

BILL
And you knew what that meant,
didn't you?

B.B.
Uh-huh.

BILL
What did that mean?

B.B.
He was dead.

BILL
(to Mommy)
She told me later, that the second
she lifted up her foot and saw him
not flapping, she knew he was dead.
Is that not the perfect visual
image of life and death? A fish
flapping on the carpet, and a fish
not flapping on the carpet. So
powerful even a five-year old child
with no concept of life and death
knew what it meant. Not only did
she know Emilio was dead, she knew
she had killed him. So she comes
running into my room, holding
Emilio in both of her little hands -
it was so cute - and she wanted me
to make Emilio better. And I asked
her, why did she step on Emilio?
And she said, she didn't know. But
I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt
Emilio, you just wanted to see what
would happen if you stepped on him,
right?

B.B.
Uh-huh.

BILL
And what happens when you stomp on
Emilio, is you kill him. And you
discovered that, didn't you?

B.B.
Uh-huh.

BILL
So we drove down to the beach, had
a little funeral, and gave Emilio a
burial at sea. And right now I'm
sure he's happy as can be, swimmin
around in fish heaven.
But the point being, our child
learned two very important lessons.
One, about life and death. The
other, somethings once you do, they
can't be undone. I knew just how
she felt
(to B.B.)
You loved Emilio, didn't you?

B.B.
Uh-huh.

BILL
Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I
did to Mommy what you did to
Emilio.

B.B.
You stomped on Mommy?

BILL
Worse.
(making his finger a gun)
I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,
like we were just doing. I shot her
for real.

B.B.
Why?

BILL
I don't know.

B.B.
Did you want to see what would
happen?

BILL
No, I knew what would happen to
Mommy if I shot her. What I didn't
know, is when I shot Mommy, what
would happen to me.

B.B.
What happened?

BILL
I was very sad. And that was when I
learned, somethings once you do,
they can never be undone.

B.B.
What happened to Mommy?

BILL
Why don't you ask Mommy.

B.B.
Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?

BILL
No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.

B.B.
Did it make you sick?

MOMMY
It put me to sleep. That's why I
haven't been with you B.B., I've
been asleep.

B.B.
But you're awake now, right?

MOMMY
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

EXT. PORCH - DAWN

Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house
drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and
the sea.

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps
across from him.

Between them the dawn sky breaks.

BILL
Did she go to sleep easy?

THE BRIDE
It took her a little bit. She was
excited. She's quite the little
chatterbox.

BILL
Well, if she doesn't like you, you
got to kill her to say hello. But
if she likes you, you can't shut
her up. She's a chip off the ole
blonde in that regards.

He holds up the bottle of vino.

BILL
Red wine?

She shakes her blonde head, no.

BILL
C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more
fun with a couple glasses of wine
in ya.

She gives him a look.

BILL
(pointing towards the
beach)
We're going to go out there and
have at it, aren't we?

She shakes her blonde head, yes.

BILL
Well, I've already had a glass. So
unless you want to win by an unfair
advantage, you should have a glass
of wine. So we're both on the same
footing wine wise.

She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.

BILL
You know, there's an old man down
here, his name is Esteban Viharo.
He was a pimp. I knew him when I
was a child. He was a friend of my
mother's. I told him about you.
When I showed him your picture he
smiles and said;
(imitating his accent)
"Yesss, I see the attraction." He
told me a story about taking me to
the movies when I was five. It was
a movie which had Lana Turner in
it. And whenever she would appear
on screen, he said I would stick my
thumb in my mouth and suck it, to
an obscure amount. And he knew
right then, this boy will be a fool
for blondes.

THE BRIDE
Who would of ever thought you'd be
such a good father?

BILL
Well not you, that's for damn sure.

She gives him another look.

THE BRIDE
Must we have to endure your little
zingers?

BILL
No we mustn't. But if you're going
to say sentences like that, in the
future, I will resist the
temptation.

THE BRIDE
Baby, you don't have a future.

Bill drinks some wine.

BILL
I sent you to L.A. and you never
came back. I thought you'd been
killed. Do you know how cruel it is
to make someone think someone they
love is dead? I mourned you. Then
in the third month of my mourning,
I track you down. I wasn't trying
to track you down, I was trying to
track down - the fucking assholes -
who I thought killed you. And when
I find you, what to I find? Not
only are you not dead, you're
getting married - to some fuckin
jerk - and you're pregnant? How do
you expect me to react?

THE BRIDE
Why do you think I hid?

BILL
Why did you leave in the first
place? You have cold eyes towards
me now. I understand their
temperature, but they were warm the
second to the last time I saw them,
or was that just my imagination?

THE BRIDE
No.

The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts
will be shown on the screen.

To give herself a running start with the story she starts it
off in Japanese;

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
You sent me to L.A. to kill that
lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.

Bill interrupts her.

BILL (ENGLISH)
You are you talking in Japanese?

The Bride explodes;

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
What the hell do you care what I
talk in? Don't you know when to
keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to
tell you what you want to know, if
you'll just shut up and listen and
stop talking! Now may I continue?

BILL
You're right, I'm wrong, continue.

THE BRIDE
The morning I left, I threw up. I
don't feel like speaking in
Japanese anymore - on the plane, I
threw up. When I got to my hotel, I
threw up. So naturally I started
thinking, maybe I might be
pregnant. So I bought one of those
home pregnancy kits. Went back to
my room and took the test. The
little strip said blue. I was going
to have a baby. I tried to call
you, but you weren't there, so I
just thought I'd call back later.

BILL
But you never did.

THE BRIDE
- Would you shut up, I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.

BILL
My apologies, please continue.

THE BRIDE
So I just figured I'd call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put
on music and danced by myself in
the hotel suite, holding my little
blue strip.
What I didn't know, was at some leg
of my journey, I was spotted. With
me in Los Angeles it didn't take
Lisa Wong long to figure out
someone put a hit out on her. So
she sent an assassin of her own to
kill me in my hotel room. As I was
dancing in euphoria, the killer
came down the hall.

There's a knock on the hotel room door.

The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.

PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt
outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.

The Bride says through the door;

THE BRIDE
Hello, can I help you?

HOTEL WOMAN
Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the
hospitality manager of the hotel. I
have a welcome gift from the
management.

Seeing it through the peephole.

THE BRIDE
Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda
busy at this second, could you
possibly come back later?

As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she
bends down to pick it up...

WHEN...

A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the
bent over woman was previously standing.

Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.

The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.

Karen aims the shotgun down at her.

With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.

It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.

The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.

Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES
the shotgun The Bride's way.

The Bride DIVES out of the way.

The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.

The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,
and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...

Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade
sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,
and drops it to the floor.

The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do
except wait to get shot.

KAREN
So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,
huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.
I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here
to kill you.

She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...

THE BRIDE
Wait a second!

Karen stops.

THE BRIDE
Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did
come here to kill your sister. But
I'm not gonna do that now.

KAREN
Oh, I know you're not --

THE BRIDE
- listen to me! I just found out,
right now - not two minutes before
you blew a hole in the door, I'm
pregnant.

Karen looks at her, "what?".

THE BRIDE
On that table is the home pregnancy
kit. On the floor by the door is
the strip that says I'm pregnant.
I'm telling you the truth, I don't
want to and I won't kill your
sister. I just want to go home.

KAREN
What is this, bullshit story number
twelve in the female assassin's
handbook?

THE BRIDE
Any other time you'd be a hundred
percent right. But this time you're
a hundred percent wrong. I'm the
deadliest woman in the world, but
right now I'm scared shitless for
my baby. Please, you hafta believe
me. Look at the strip, it's on the
floor.

Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the
floor.

KAREN
Sit down on that bed and put your
hands behind your head.

The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off
the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the
directions on the box.

THE BRIDE
Blue means pregnant.

KAREN
I'll read it myself, thank you.

It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.

KAREN
Okay, say I were to believe you,
what then?

THE BRIDE
Just go home. I'll do the same.

Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she
leaves, she says;

KAREN
You fucked with the Wong sisters.

BACK ON THE PORCH

THE BRIDE
Facing Karen Wong, was the most
frightening moment I have ever
experienced. And that includes
three years with that evil bastard
Pai Mei. Before that strip turned
blue, I was a woman, I was your
woman. I was a killer, who killed
for you. Before that strip turned
blue, I would have jumped a
motorcycle on to a speeding train
...for you. But once that strip
turned blue, I could no longer do
any of those things. Not anymore.
Because now I was a mother. A
mother who only had one thought on
her mind. Please don't harm my
baby. Can you understand that?

BILL
Yes. But why tell me now, and not
then?

THE BRIDE
You wouldn't have let me go.
Specially once you found out I was
pregnant. You would've tried to
talk me out of it. It would have
been a big scene. I just said fuck
it.

Starting to get mad.

BILL
Fuck who?

THE BRIDE
Bill, you couldn't know I was
pregnant, once you knew, you'd
claim it, and I didn't want that.

BILL
That's not your decision to make.

THE BRIDE
Yes, but it's the right decision.
And I made it for my daughter.
Everybody on this earth deserves to
start with a clean slate. But with
us - my daughter would be born into
a world she shouldn't be. Robbing
her of the one thing everybody
deserves. She would be born with
blood stains. I had to choose. I
chose her.

She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her
turn.

THE BRIDE
You know five years ago, if I had
to make a list of impossible things
that could never happen.
You performing a coup de grace on
me by bustin a cap in my crown,
would be right at the top of the
list.
(beat)
I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?

Bill listens stoney, then;

BILL
I'm sorry was that a question? Of
impossible things that could never
happen - yes in this instance you
would have been wrong.

The Bride listens stoney, then;

THE BRIDE
Well?

BILL
Well what?

THE BRIDE
Explain yourself.

BILL
I already have. When I told you the
story of when I thought you were
dead. Didn't you get how badly I
felt?

THE BRIDE
You call that an explanation?

BILL
Well if that's too cryptic let's
get literal.
(beat)
There are consequences to breaking
the heart of a murdering bastard.
You experienced some of them.

That's his explanation.

She hears it.

They both understand one another.

THE BRIDE
You and I have unfinished business.

BILL
Baby, you ain't kidding.

They both laugh.

BILL
You know how proud I am of you,
don't you?

THE BRIDE
Yes.

BILL
You know I was rooting for you,
don't you?

THE BRIDE
I figured.

BILL
You know on that beach out there I
want you to be the victor?

She nods her head, yes.

BILL
You also know you're going to have
to defeat me. I can't just give it
to you, even though I want to.

THE BRIDE
It won't be necessary for you to
give me anything. I've surpassed
you. I'll take it.

BILL
Well, as they say in Missouri, show
me.

EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,
The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket
off, face each other in a combat stance.

The BRIDE
Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in
its sheath.

BILL
stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his
student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He
removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.

WIDE SHOT
The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend
to charge/attack...stand in showdown stance.

The BRIDE
The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is
remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left
hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right
empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in
Japanese;

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Attack me.

She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a
standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an
eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for
his attack.

He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat
grip, to charge her.

BILL
(to himself)
That's my girl.

He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...

She stands motionless...

Unblinking...

Watching him coming...

No fear....

No expression...

We go back and forth, close, wide, low.

TILL...

They meet...

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its
grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at
her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his
sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up
a little blood...he looks at her.

Their faces are very close...

The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our
eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with
compassion.

BILL
He taught you the ten point palm
exploding heart technique?

THE BRIDE
Of course he did.

BILL
Why didn't you tell me?

She doesn't have an answer.

She looks at him apologetically;

THE BRIDE
I don't know...Because...I'm
a...bad person.

He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;

BILL
No. You're not a bad person. You're
a terrific person. You're my
favorite person. But every once in
awhile...you can be a real cunt.

They smile at each other.

Then...

Bill turns his back to her...

And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each
step his heart swells, on the fifth...

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...

He falls to the beach...dead.

The Bride walks over to his body.

She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.

Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the
tiniest of crimson smudges.

She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's
blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.

She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.

The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this
purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

Beatrix, in a moment of enormous generosity, allows herself,
one final tear, shed for her corrupter, her enemy, the father
of her child,...her MAN. The tear is for her as well. For
she's very aware she will never ever be completely any other
man's WOMAN.

EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.

EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.

The blade disappears inside the sheath.

The teardrop falls of her chin.

Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished
business, is completed.

The Bride exits the beach.

Bill doesn't.
SERIES OF SHOTS END FILM
As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack.

We see the Bride, get B.B.

The Bride and B.B. are driving away.

The Bride and B.B. eating in a coffee shop.

The Bride and B.B. in a motel room. They both wear bath
towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. The Bride sits
behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head.

The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.

It's the morning...

B.B. Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning
cartoons on T.V.

INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MORNING

The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying
her eyes out.

She shoves a towel in her mouth so B.B. won't hear her.

We wonder for a moment what's wrong...

Till we see her face in CU...

Her tears are tears of joy.

She can't believe this is even happening.

Her daughter is alive. They're together. They get to begin
again.

She covers her mouth so B.B. won't hear her crying and get
worried or confused.

But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel
room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes,
happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. Over
and over again....

Thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you
god.

She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she
walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby,
hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning
cartoons.

TWO SHOT CU
Both blonde heads, the big one and the little one, next to
each other, watching T.V.

The lioness has been reunited with her cub, and all is right
in the jungle.

BLACK FRAME
FADE IN:
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back
turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We
hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF
SCREEN.

MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

MICKEY
What kind of pies do you have?

MABEL
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.

MICKEY
Which do you recommend?

MABEL
The key lime is great, but it's
an acquired taste.

MICKEY
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten
years.

MABEL
When ya had it, did ya like it?

MICKEY
No, but that don't mean much. I was a
completely different person ten years
ago. Let's give key lime a day in
court. And a large glass of milk.

Mabel turns to her right.

MABEL
(to someone O.S.)
Should I make that two pieces?

CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,
Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back
is to the camera as well.

MALLORY
Nada, Rosey.

MABEL
(annoyed)
My name's not Rosey.
(points at name tag)
It's Mabel.

Mabel exits FRAME.

MALLORY
Whatever.

Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next
to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,
she selects a quarter.

MABEL
Hey, what the hell do you think you're
doin'?

Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes
follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,
selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,
and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee
shop.

Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

MABEL
(to Mickey)
She ought not be doing that. That's
for Jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.

CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time
we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:

MICKEY
I can't take her anywhere.

Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
shop. She's really cooking and smoking.

Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the
hell these people are.

Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his
pie and milk.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls
up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three
tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the
pickup's hood.

EARL
Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot.
Y'all go inside. I'm gonna check 'er
out.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in
their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of
Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

SONNY
Good God almighty. What the hell is
that?

OTIS
That's a bitch outta hell, son.

Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

SONNY
Take a run at 'er, kiddo.

Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next
to Mickey.

SONNY
Miller, Mabel.

MABEL
Comin' up.

Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's
doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see
him.

Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a
swig, enjoying the floor show.

SONNY
(to Mickey)
That's some sweet piece of meat, ain't
it?

Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression
betrays nothing.

MICKEY
Her name's Mallory.

The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.

Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.

OTIS
Hells Bells! Don't stop now sugar.
I'm just getting warmed up.

Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to
Sonny.

Sonny gurgles out a laugh.

SONNY
Hey, I think she's sweet on you.

Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face
spinning him around.

Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.

Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the
table, cracking the linoleum.

Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.

Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches
hold of his shoulder.

Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points
his finger at him, threateningly.

Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife
out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.

Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.
Blood flows from the wound.

MICKEY
Just because my woman's mopping up the
floor with your buddy is no reason for
you to join in.

Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck
knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be
no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices
made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.

The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,
wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
his jacket and FIRES.

BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It
HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
the ground, screaming.

Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass
window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.

Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.

Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which
SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the
ground dead.

Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING
his head repeatedly on the floor.

MICKEY
Honey.

Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to
Mickey's side.

Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his
cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee
pot, crying.

MICKEY
(to Mallory)
Pick one.

Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth
from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.

MALLORY
Eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a
nigger by the tow. If he hollers, let
him go. Eanie, meanie, minie, moe. My
mom told me to pick the best one and
you are it.

She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.

MABEL
NO!

Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot
Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She
hits the floor dead.

Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball
Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.

MALLORY
When you tell people what went on here,
tell 'em Mickey and Mallory Knox did
this. Understand?

Pinball Cowboy nods yes.

The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.
Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.

INT. POLICE STATION (SQUERI'S OFFICE) - DAY

CAMERA is position in the middle of the office. The door is in
the middle of the frame.

JACK SCAGNETTI flings the door open and steps inside Squeri's
office. Squeri's never seen.

SCAGNETTI
You wanted to see me, Capt'n?

CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
Scagnetti, go up to interrogation room
C. Dewight McClusky, chairman of the
prison board, is waiting to meet you.
You're gonna deliver two prisoners from
the county jail to Nystrom Insane
Asylum in Bakersfield.

SCAGNETTI
This is bullshit. I'm a detective.
You want an errand boy, call Jerry
Lewis.

Scagnetti spins around and leaves the room, SLAMMING the door
shut behind him. Captain Squeri shouts after him.

CAPTAIN SQUERI (O.S.)
Jack!

INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

Police Detective Scagnetti walks rapidly down the hallway,
wearing an old, wrinkly, black suit jacket.

PEOPLE walk by in the F.G. and B.G. Scagnetti slips an already
tied tie over his head.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM C - DAY

DEWIGHT MCCLUSKY, a man in his fifties, wearing a business suit,
stands in the F.G. reading a book with his back to the door.
In the B.G., Scagnetti enters the room.

SCAGNETTI
Jack Scagnetti. You wanted to see me?

McClusky turns toward Scagnetti.

MCCLUSKY
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case,
Scagnetti. You put an end to a
nightmare. The ladies of this city can
get to sleep again, and they have you
to thank.

SCAGNETTI
Thank you, sir.

MCCLUSKY
Dewight McClusky of the California
Prison Board. Take a seat please.

Scagnetti lowers into a chair in front of the interrogation
table.

MCCLUSKY
(referring to book)
This is damn good reading. I'm
surprised Hollywood hasn't found you.
This would make a better movie than
that 'Serpico' shit.

McClusky puts the book down, we see the title: 'CURTIS FOX: The
Capture and Death of a Serial Killer'. Author: Jack Scagnetti.
McClusky sits on the edge of the table, facing Scagnetti. He
lifts a file off the table, then tosses it in Scagnetti's lap.

MCCLUSKY
I think you'll find that good reading
as well. Mickey and Mallory's file.
You familiar with them?

Scagnetti opens it. It's the files, reports, and photographs
of Mickey and Mallory Knox. Scagnetti's face lights up.

SCAGNETTI
Who isn't?

MCCLUSKY
You been followin' the news coverage?

SCAGNETTI
They've been separated since their
incarceration in a couple of
penitentiaries---

MCCLUSKY
Susanville, Soledade.

SCAGNETTI
They've killed a shitload of inmates
and guards---

MCCLUSKY
Five inmates, eight guards and one
psychiatrist all in one year's time...
Very good. You do keep up with the
headlines.

Scagnetti nods.

MCCLUSKY
Look, our situation in a nutshell is,
no prison wants 'em, no prison will
take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes,
where the warden's as hard as a bar of
iron. No one wants those fuckin'
assholes behind their walls, dealin'
with 'em day in, day out.

SCAGNETTI
I can appreciate that.

MCCLUSKY
So can we. So the solution to our
little problem is we had them deemed
crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to
Nystrom Asylum for the criminally
insane.

SCAGNETTI
Lobotomy Bay?

MCCLUSKY
You've heard of it?

SCAGNETTI
So, how do I fit into this scheme?

MCCLUSKY
The public loves you Jack...You don't
mind if I call you Jack, do you?

SCAGNETTI
By all means.

MCCLUSKY
You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six
years on the force, a best-seller out on
paperback...

McClusky grabs Scagnetti's book and reads from the back cover.

MCCLUSKY
A modern day Pat Garret. A hell bent
lawman with a deadly axe to grind with
maniacs.

McClusky lowers the book.

MCCLUSKY
You're a breathing icon of justice and
that's why you were chosen to deliver
Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison
board we, knows that once you get them
on the road if anything should happen,
an escape attempt, an accident, fire,
anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti
would be there to look out for his
public's best interests.

SCAGNETTI
I see.

MCCLUSKY
You write the script Jack, call it,
'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination
of Mickey and Mallory', whatever...
Have we found our man?

Hold on Scagnetti.

CUT TO:

INT. COUNTY JAIL - CELL BLOCK CORRIDOR - DAY

SCAGNETTI'S POV: McClusky stands next to a big iron door. He
BANGS on it with is fist. We stay on Scagnetti's POV through
this scene.

MCCLUSKY
Pete, open it up! I'm comin' through
with a visitor!

A BUZZER SOUNDS

McClusky opens the door and we follow him down the corridor. As
soon as the door opens, we can hear a female voice singing the
song 'Long Time Woman'.

McClusky turns to Scagnetti as they walk.

MCCLUSKY
Well, Jack, I'll tell ya, in all my
years with the penal institution, and
I'll tell ya that's no small number,
Mickey and Mallory Knox are without a
doubt the most twisted, depraved group
of fucks it's ever been my displeasure
to lay my eyes on. I mean, those two
rat shits are a walkin' reminder of
just how fucked up our system really
is.

The song 'Long Time Woman' is getting louder as they proceed.

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
Who's the song bird?

MCCLUSKY
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory
Knox. This little lady drowned her
father in a fish tank.

INSERT: INT. A LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CU of a home aquarium with fish swimming around. Suddenly
Mallory's FATHER'S head is shoved into the tank.

INSERT: INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

MEDIUM CU of Mallory's MOTHER lying asleep in bed, mouth open.
What looks like a gas nozzle appears at the top of the FRAME,
pouring gasoline all over her face. She coughs and gags.
CAMERA PANS up and we see Mickey holding a gas can.

CU of Mallory with a lit match by her face. She tosses it in
front of her. We hear the SOUNDS of Mallory's mother igniting.

BACK TO: PRISON CORRIDOR

Still SCAGNETTI'S POV:

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
Why?

McClusky's still walking ahead of us.

MCCLUSKY
Because they wouldn't give them their
blessing for marriage.

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
Ain't love grand.

McClusky laughs.

MCCLUSKY
Ain't love grand. That's a good one.

Still SCAGNETTI'S POV: We look down from McClusky to Mallory's
file in our hands. It contains her picture and lists her color
of hair, color of eyes, height, weight, race, etc. Beneath that
is a column which reads: PSYCHIATRIC REMARKS.

As we read the remarks, we hear a DOCTOR'S VOICE read aloud.

FEMALE PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)
When pressed about the reason for the
murders...patient became hostile...

INSERT: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Looking trashy, wild, and animalistic, Mallory's a sex machine
dressed in a prison gown. She sits in a chair, looking directly
at the CAMERA.

MALLORY
I don't owe you an explanation! I don't
owe you shit! I'm not here for your
entertainment. If I don't tell you
what you wanna hear, what are you gonna
do? Throw me in jail? I'm already
there, you stupid pigfucker. You gonna
give me some more time? I've already
got life. What else you got to
threaten me with? Death? I'd like to
see you fuckin' try. I haven't met one
motherfucker here who's shown me shit!

BACK TO DEATH ROW CORRIDOR:

Still on SCAGNETTI'S POV:

We look up from the fill and see McClusky's leaning against a
cell door.

We hear somebody signing 'Long Time Woman' inside the cell.

We move to McClusky, who looking into the CAMERA, gestures
toward the cell.

MCCLUSKY
Here she is...you know her, you
love her, you can't live without
her...Mallory Knox.

We PAN from McClusky to the inside of the cell where we see
Mallory, her back to us, singing and dancing.

INT. PRISON (MALLORY KNOX'S CELL) - DAY

CU of Mallory's face singing 'Long Time Woman'.

MALLORY
(singing)
99 years is a long, long time. Look at
me, I will never be free, I'm a long time
woman...

MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
Hey, Knox! Somebody out here wants to
meet you.

Mallory just keeps on truckin'.

MALLORY
(singing)
Been workin' on the road now.
Been workin' by the sea.
Been workin' in the cane fields.
and I wanna be free...

MALLORY'S POV: We stare at McClusky and Scagnetti for a second.
Then, like a bull, we charge/DOLLY straight at them. Mallory
screams O.S. We SMASH headfirst into the bars. Mallory's POV
flings up, looking at the ceiling, then falls backward.

MEDIUM TIGHT SHOT of floor, Mallory falls into FRAME, out cold.

CU on Scagnetti through the cell bars.

SCAGNETTI
Jesus Christ!

CAMERA PANS over to CU on McClusky.

MCCLUSKY
Don't worry about it. She does that
all the time.

BACK TO: Mallory on the floor, still unconscious with blood
trickling down her scalp.

MCCLUSKY (O.S.)
Follow me.

INT. PRISON (LONG CORRIDOR) - DAY

CAMERA is at the end of a long corridor. McClusky and Scagnetti
approach from the other end. Scagnetti's studying the files.

PHIL WURLITZER comes up behind the two men.

WURLITZER
You duckin' me Dewight?

MCCLUSKY
Hey, Phil, how the hell are ya?

WURLITZER
(to Scagnetti)
This son of a bitch is chairman of the
prison board, but it's like pullin'
teeth to get him down to a prison.

MCCLUSKY
The only reason I'm here now is to set
him straight, and I'm on the next
flight out.
(to Scagnetti)
Jack, this is the superintendent of the
jail. Phil Wurlitzer. He's the man
who's got the power of the pen here.

Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti.

WURLITZER
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your
book. I'm impressed. Good work on
Curtis Fox.

SCAGNETTI
Thanks.

MCCLUSKY
From now on, you'll be dealin' with
Phil. He can answer all the questions
you got about the arrangements. I'm
gonna be bidding you good luck and
adieu in about twenty minutes. My
flight back to Sacramento leaves LAX in
a hour.

WURLITZER
And I want you to know, we'll all cry a
river when you're gone.

They all laugh.

SCAGNETTI
What's the travelling arrangements?

WURLITZER
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be
together. So, we'll put you on one of
our prison busses and you'll take
Mallory first, then you'll come back
for Mickey.

SCAGNETTI
And where do you keep Mickey?

WURLITZER
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest,
darkest cell in the whole place. But
it just so happens that right now he's
got a special visitor.

SCAGNETTI
Who?

WURLITZER
Wayne Gayle.

SCAGNETTI
(surprised)
Wayne Gayle!

INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY

WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la
Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail
visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.
Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a
miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.

WAYNE
(into recorder)
Testing one...two...three...
testing...one...three...over,
over, over, Mickey Knox meeting.

Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It
works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the
recorder in his sport coat jacket.

The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into
the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country
jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around
his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy
chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body
and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands
and feet are double cuffed.

The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in
half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound
in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.
Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,
jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,
intimidating, and fascinating figure.

Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.

WAYNE
(to himself)
Showtime.

Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of
the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by
the wall.

WAYNE
Hello Mickey. We've never been
introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I
don't know if you've ever heard of me
or remember me. I was one of the
reporters outside the courthouse during
your trial---

MICKEY
Everybody knows who you are. You're
famous.

Wayne pauses and retorts.

WAYNE
I could say the same thing about you.
(smiles)
I want to thank you very much for
seeing me...

Mickey is silent.

WAYNE
I have a television show. It's very
popular. Every week we do a profile on
a different serial killer. You don't
mind if I call you a serial killer, do
you?

Mickey shakes his head no.

WAYNE
The episode we did on Mickey and
Mallory was one of our most popular ones.

MICKEY
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?

WAYNE
Yes.

MICKEY
Whose ratings were higher?

WAYNE
Yours.

MICKEY
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on
him?

WAYNE
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.

MICKEY
Good...yuppie piece of shit.

WAYNE
What I'd like to do---

MICKEY
How 'bout Manson?

WAYNE
Manson beat you.

MICKEY
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the
king.

WAYNE
We've been waiting to do a follow up
episode on you for a long time. And
that time has definitely come.
(pause)
I feel it's apparent to anyone who's
hip to what's going on that the prison
board has thrown the constitution
straight out the fuckin' window.
You and Mallory may be killers, but
you're not insane. You belong in a
prison, not in an asylum. The prison
board is blatantly railroading you into
a hospital for the sole purpose of
turning you into vegetables. Now some
people are saying, 'So what?' I am not
one of those people. If we avert our
eyes while they do this to you, we give
them permission to do it again whenever
they see fit. Today they wipe clean
your mind because they feel your
actions are dangerous, tomorrow they
wipe clean my mind because they feel
what I say is dangerous. Where does
it all stop?

No response from Mickey.

WAYNE
My problem Mickey, is that you don't
exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone
on this. I need your help. I want
what the prison board is doing to be
the focus of our follow up episode.
Now I have interviews with chairman of
the prison board Dewight McClusky about
this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,
Mickey, he looks bad. The two
psychologists they used for their
psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk
to us, which always looks bad. I have
an interview with both the judge of
your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the
psychologist and author, Emil
Reinghold, both of which discount the
notion that you're insane. You put
that all together, and what the state
is doing becomes obvious. But the
network isn't satisfied. They feel the
show needs another element. It needs
you. In order to put the show on the
air, I need to get an interview with
you. You haven't talked to the press
since your trial. Now, a few days
before you get transferred to an
asylum, you grant an interview on
television with Wayne Gayle. We're
talkin' a media event here. Every son
of a bitch out the with a TV set's
gonna tune in to see that.
We'll make their motives so blatant,
we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole
thing. At least for a little while,
the publicity would keep them from just
giving you and Mallory lobotomies.
Well, whatta ya say?

MICKEY
Have you talked to Mallory about this?

WAYNE
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now
you're not supposed to know anything
about what's going on with her, but I'm
gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you
two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't
spoken one word.

MICKEY
She doesn't talk?

WAYNE
Not to anybody. She sings.

MICKEY
She sings? What does she sing?

WAYNE
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The
Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty
Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be
With You'. That's what I hear anyway.
Her behaviour was the main thing the
doctors' report used against you. So
even if she would see me, which she
won't, I couldn't put her on camera
anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are
you insane?' And she starts singing
'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road',
that blows our whole case.

Mickey cracks a smile.

The guards come over to take him away.

DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
Time, motherfucker!

They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair. Wayne stands.

WAYNE
Wait a minute, Mickey, I need an
answer.

Mickey doesn't respond. He just leaves with the guards.

WAYNE
(yells after him)
Just think about it. But don't think
too long.

INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

MEDIUM CU of Mickey curled up by his bed, writing Mallory a
letter.

MICKEY (V.O.)
Dearest Mallory. My cell is so cold.
At night I get the chills. I pretend
you're lying next to me, holding me
from behind with your leg draped over
mine and your arms wrapped tightly
around me. I lie in my cell...

DISSOLVE TO:

WIDE SHOT in cell behind Mickey. We slowly DOLLY back.

MICKEY (V.O.)
...and imagine kissing you. Not
making love, just kissing for hours and
hours on end. I remember everything
about our time. I remember every joke
you ever told.

CU of the letter being written over the WIDE SHOT.

MICKEY (V.O.)
I remember every secret you ever
shared. Shared or revealed? I think
shared is proper. I remember every
single time you laughed.

ECU of Mickey, mouthing the words as he writes, we can hear
Mallory's laugh - a distant haunting echo.

MICKEY
I remember every meal we ever ate. I
remember your cooking. I especially
remember your casseroles. I remember
watching David Letterman.

We hear the echo of television laughter.

MICKEY
I remember driving fast...faster,
man, fast behind the wheel of the Coupe
de Ville.

The sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we...

CUT TO:

EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

CAMERA sits on the hood looking down at Mickey and Mallory,
driving fast -- SLOW MOTION. A hurricane of wind whips through
their hair. Mallory laughs wildly as she wraps her arms around
Mickey and kisses.

MICKEY (V.O.)
You, baby, by my side. Your bare feet
up on the dash, singing along with the
radio 'Needles And Pins', 'He's A
Rebel', 'You're My World', 'Ring Of
Fire', 'Love Grows Where My Rosemary
Goes', 'Groove Me'...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COUPE DE VILLE - NIGHT

Coupe de Ville parked on the road side. Mickey is in the
drivers seat with his feet on the dash watching Mallory dance on
the hood of the car.

MICKEY (V.O.)
And your dancing, my God, your dancing.
I lie on my bed and go over every day,
every minute of our happiness. Every
day take a day of our time and go
through it hour by hour. I don't jump
ahead either. I take it as it comes,
and I live that day again. That way
when I get to our first kiss...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

The screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear
in the flame kissing passionately.

MICKEY (V.O.)
The killing of your parents, our
wedding...They're not just memories.
I feel that joy again...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

MEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face
and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over
Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES.

WAYNE
(reading out loud)
'After taking a few days to reflect on
your offer, I've come to the conclusion
that you are one hundred percent
correct. A national TV interview would
be very advantageous to both Mallory
and I. The only obstacle is they're
shipping me out to the funny farm in
four days. However, that is your
problem and not mine. I feel confident
you'll manage. Here's to us making
television history. Sincerely, Mickey
Knox.'

Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.

WAYNE
Am I a God or what?

We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's
decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the
remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they
all pretend they are praying to him.

The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild
t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On
Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears
wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE,
Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a
baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the
weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his
recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie
always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are
all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's
stylish yuppie demeanour.

Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold
out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks
straight from the bottle.

NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl
Friday' pace.

WAYNE
Drink up! This is a celebration. This
is the day we received word we were
gonna make television history. We're
gonna have the first sit down, in depth
interview with the most charismatic
serial killer ever, one day before he's
being shipped to a mental hospital for
the rest of his life. This is one of
those golden moments that happens maybe
only four times in a lucky journalist's
career. This is Wallace with Noriega,
this is Elton John confessing his
bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this
is the tearful reporting of the
Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut
setting the record straight on
Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo,
this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting
Deep Throat in an underground parking
lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The
Ten Days That Shook The World', this is
the hippies' bloody palms at Kent
State, the Maysles brothers at
Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost
interviews...

ROGER
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the
destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.

Everybody laughs.

SCOTT
What's the schedule, mein fuehre?

As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook.
She never speaks, just writes.

WAYNE
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our
shit together. The day after that
they're shippin' Mallory. That's when
we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause
the next day he goes.

SCOTT
Would the network really not run it
without the interview?

WAYNE
Are you kidding? The last thing they
expected was Mickey Knox to get up
close and personal. They wanted a
follow up episode and would've taken
anything I had given them. I'm not
gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna
make him think his grey matter depends
on it. When I told Woody and the brass
about this coup, they practically shit
a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick.
They want to expand the show to a hour,
and they want it on immediately.

ROGER
How immediate is immediately?

WAYNE
Next week's episode.

Wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne.

ROGER
We don't got enough footage for a hour
follow up.

SCOTT
(pointing at Roger)
What he said.

WAYNE
Rape and pillage the first episode,
just change the order a bit. Those
sons of bitches out there ain't gonna
know the difference. All that shit is
just filler for the interview anyway.
We film a new intro. Show some old
footage from the first episode so the
get a brief history of Mickey and
Mallory. We introduce a new angle...
what the prison board is up to. We
see some of that new shit, then the
rest of the show is the interview. Now
what's so fuckin' hard about that? Oh,
Julie make a note: I need Woody to get
me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five'
broadcast to promote next weeks show.
We'll do a feed right from the jail
while we're wrapping up with Mickey.

Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook. Wayne snaps at Scott.

WAYNE
You too Scott, Betacam and a remote,
keep it simple.

Scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne.

SCOTT
Betacam with remote and two-way comm
link. Got it.
(opens eyes)
How about the interview...What camera
do you want to use?

Wayne closes his eyes.

WAYNE
I see...high contrast sixteen
millimetre black and white, and I mean
black and white, where the black's
black and the white's white. This is
for posterity, so fuck video. Film!
Film! Film!

Wayne pounds on the table. CU of Unruly Julie writing in her
notebook: 'Film...film...film!'

WAYNE
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and
planning the interview.
(points at Roger & Scott)
You two go down to the editing bay,
take the old footage and the new
footage, put it together, and see what
we got. Get it into shape so when we
finish the interview, we can just stick
it in.

SCOTT
When do you want the assembly?

WAYNE
Tomorrow.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 'TOMORROW'

CUT TO:

INT. TV STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

CAMERA leads Wayne, who's talking to Unruly Julie. As they
march quickly through the halls Julie writes furiously in her
notebook.

WAYNE
At that point I'll ask him if he
believes in God. If he says yes, I'll
ask him what he thinks God would make
of his actions. And is he worried
about burning in hell? If he says no,
I'll say, 'Well, Mickey, what do you
believe in?' And hopefully he'll say
something like a live round of ammo,
the expression on the face of a man he
just split up the middle, Mallory's
eyes, sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll.
He's bound to say something
provocative.

Wayne and Unruly Julie enter the video editing room. Scott and
Roger are sitting at the editing bay. Everybody is wearing, and
looks like they slept in, the same clothes as the night before,
except Wayne, who's in another sweater and looks alert and snappy.

WAYNE
Okay, boys, let's have it.

SCOTT
Well, basically, what we did was put
part of the old show on first...

ROGER
But we changed the order around so it
wasn't super obvious...

SCOTT
Then we added the new shit to the
tail...

ROGER
So we film the interview, and we can
just slap it on at the end.

Wayne and Unruly Julie grab chairs and sit.

WAYNE
Okay, let's see it.

CU of video monitor screen. We see a show rewinding.

ROGER (O.S.)
Now we got to film a new intro for the
follow up episode. But we put the
intro for the first episode at the
beginning temporarily so you can see it
with some scope.

WAYNE (V.O.)
I hear ya. Play.

CU of Roger's hand pressing a play button.

CUT TO:

Static. Then the opening slate for 'AMERICAN MANIACS' fills the
SCREEN.

BEGIN: HIGHWAY - DAY

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

WAYNE GAYLE is standing in the middle of an empty highway. The
CAMERA looks up from the ground. With a WIDE ANGLE lens, he
looks practically mythic.

Wayne speaks into the camera.

WAYNE
Hello. Welcome to 'American Maniacs'.
I'm your host Wayne Gayle. And this is
Highway 58.

Wayne walks toward the CAMERA. We DOLLY back.

WAYNE
To some the fastest distance between
point A and point B. To others a
beautiful stretch to the American
landscape. But to Mickey and Mallory
Knox, it was a candy land of murder and
mayhem.

While we hear Wayne's narration, we see a MONTAGE of home 8mm
movie footage. These are films of Mickey and Mallory living a
normal life.

In front of the store three windbreaker cops have Mickey on the
ground, beating him with nightsticks. One COP lies on the
ground near them, holding his hands over his face, screaming.

To the left Mallory is slugging it out with a windbreaker COP,

Wayne Gayle walks down the street. The CAMERA walks with him.
He speaks into the camera.

WAYNE
Mickey and Mallory's idea of an armed
robbery was a little different than
most. It was an assault, actually.

Wayne interviews BISHOP, a young blonde kid with a 'Flock of Sea
Gulls' haircut. Bishop's name appears on the SCREEN.

BISHOP
Well. I knew that Mickey and Mallory
kill everybody when they're through,
except for one clerk. There were a
couple of people in the store then, and
I was working with Stevo. And I like
Stevo, you know? But I was thinking,
what could I do to make them pick me to
be the clerk that gets to live?

INT. 7/11 STORE - DAY

This scene is shot through the STORE'S BLACK & WHITE VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The date and time of day are burned into

Mickey and Mallory charge into a 7/11 store, cocking their
shotguns and shouting things.

Mickey SHOOTS a CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.

Mallory BLASTS a FEMALE CUSTOMER who lies on the ground screaming.

Mickey points his shotgun at Bishop the store clerk and screams:

MICKEY
Money! Money! Money! Fast! Fast!
Faster! Faster! Faster than that!

Bishop stuffs money in a bag as Mallory guards the door, shotgun
ready.

STEVO, the other store clerk, walks in from the back room
carrying boxes and wearing a walkman.

Mickey and Mallory spin around and shoot him.

As all this mayhem happens before our disbelieving eyes, Wayne's
narration happens over it.

Angeles county courthouse like moths to
a flame.

INT. WAYNE'S STUDIO - DAY

Wayne talks to us.

WAYNE
The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder
trial was so event filled it made the
crime spree that took place before pale
by comparison. The first point was the
decision of Mickey's to act as his own
council. Now this in itself is not
unheard of, for instance, Ted Bundy
acted as his own council as well. What
was unexpected was how well Mickey's
performance would be.

INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY

Wayne interviews JUDGE BURT STEINSMA in his den at home.

WAYNE (V.O.)
We spoke with Burt Steinsma, who was
the presiding judge during the Knox
trial.

JUDGE STEINSMA
Mickey was surprisingly effective.
When I was told I was to be the judge
of this trial and then I was told
Mickey Knox would be handling his own
defence, I got a headache that lasted
five days. But at first I breathed a
sigh of relief. Mickey showed up very
prepared, and proved to be an excellent
amateur lawyer.

INT. WANDA BISBING'S OFFICE - DAY

Interview with state prosecutor WANDA BISBING, an attractive
woman in her forties.

WAYNE (V.O.)
However, this opinion isn't shared by
the state's prosecutor on this case,
Wanda Bisbing.

Wayne's with Bisbing.

WAYNE
Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed
up very prepared and proved to be an
excellent amateur attorney.

BISBING
Oh, that's rich. Well, considering
that Mickey Knox turn his court into
a mockery and personally made him look
like a fool, I'd say that's very
benevolent of Judge Steinsma. As far
as Mickey being an excellent amateur
lawyer, maybe I'm old fashioned, but
when I went to law school, we were
taught the object was to win the case,
which I did.

INT. WAYNE'S STUDIO - DAY

Wayne talks to us.

WAYNE
The nation caught fire to Mickey and
Mallory fever, Mickey and Mallory
mania, if you will, as the merits to
Mickey's talent as a defence attorney
became apparent.
Law students from all ends of the
country converged on Los Angeles as
legal history took a new course. But
that was only the lemon next to the
pie. And that pie is you, the American
people. That pie is the way the
strangely charismatic, and make no
mistake, they are charismatic, Mickey
and Mallory have captured the public's
interest, fear, and in some cases,
admiration.

EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY

Wayne interviews three long-haired guys: CHUCK, STEVE, and JEFF.

WAYNE
What do you think of Mickey and
Mallory?

CHUCK
Hot.

JEFF
Hot.

STEVE
Totally hot.

CHUCK
Mickey and Mallory's the best thing to
happen to mass murder since Manson.

STEVE
Forty-eight people known. They're way
cooler than Manson.

CUT TO: Wayne interviewing MORGAN and PAGE, two young girls.

WAYNE
What do you think of Mickey and
Mallory?

MORGAN
Well, he's just...I dunno...
charismatic.

PAGE
They're so romantic.

CUT TO: Wayne interviewing an INTENSE COP.

INTENSE COP
I'm here to watch the judge give those
two shit asses (BLEEP) the stiffest
sentence the law allows. I want to see
their faces when the state says 'they
are the worst scum sucking, degenerate,
douche bag, filthy, I don't know what's
ever shit (BLEEP) out.
(referring to crowd
behind him)
And these assholes (BLEEP) are making
heroes outta sickos. You wanna know
who a hero is? You wanna know? I'll
tell ya who a Goddamn hero is. Mike
Griffin. Mike fuckin' (BLEEP) Griffin
is who these misguided assholes (BLEEP)
should be revering. You know why Mike
Jerome Griffin is a hero? I'll tell ya
why. Because he was killed in the line
of duty. Do you want to know how he
died?

WAYNE
Yes.

INTENSE COP
I'll tell you. Mike Jerome Griffin was
killed in the line of duty by those two
anti-heroes.

CUT TO: Wayne interviewing RUSSELL VOSSLER, Harvard law student.

WAYNE
Tell me, Mr. Vossler, how many days of
the trial have you attended?

RUSSELL
Ahhh yesss, I've been fortunate enough
to attend two days. Law history in the
making. I've been a participant.

WAYNE
And you being a Harvard law student,
what is your opinion of Mickey Knox's
performance?

RUSSELL
Ahhh, Mickey's pistolero savvy in the
courtroom trial rivals, dare I say
conquers that of master Melvin Belli.
He's like a magnificent loose cannon,
firing point blank in the prosecutor's
face. It is my anticipation---

BACK TO: The long-haired guys, Chuck, Jeff & Steve as Wayne
speaks.

WAYNE
You're talking about a man and a woman
who killed innocent people.

STEVE
Don't get us wrong...

CHUCK
We respect human life an' all.

JEFF
It's a tragedy.

STEVE
But...if I was a serial killer,
which I'm not, but if I was, I'd be
like Mickey.

CUT TO: Wayne talking with MARVIN, a black man.

MARVIN
They're like that crazy mother in the
first Dirty Harry movie. Member that
crazy ass mother? They're like him.
Mickey and Mallory be doin' some
cold-blooded shit. When I hear about
some of the shit they be doin' on TV, I
say 'Damn, that's fucked (BLEEP) up.'

BACK TO: The two young girls, Morgan & Page as Wayne speaks.

INT. GOLD'S GYM - DAY

Wayne's sitting in the gym. Behind him MUSCLE MEN are working
out. Their GRUNTING sounds fill the background. Wayne looks up
and just OFF CAMERA to the people he's interviewing.

WAYNE
What do you think of Mickey and
Mallory?

ECU on SIMON and NORMAN HUN, two brothers/bodybuilders, in a
head SHOT.

SIMON
I admire them.

NORMAN
I do, too.

WAYNE
(confused)
But how can you say that?

SIMON
They're mesmerising.

NORMAN
Hypnotizing.

SIMON
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'

WAYNE
Yes.

NORMAN
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold
Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou
Ferigno.

WAYNE
Yes.

SIMON
Through the power of the simple word---

NORMAN
And a snake-eye glare.

SIMON
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was
able to totally psyche out any
confidence Ferigno had.

NORMAN
He squashed him mentally before
physically defeating him.

SIMON
He had the edge. The mind's edge.

NORMAN
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.

SIMON
Only on a much grander scale.

NORMAN
They've hypnotized the nation.

SIMON
Schwartzenegger was the king of the
edge before they came along.

The CU of the brothers ZOOMS back.

WAYNE
You say this and yet...you two are
both victims of Mickey and Mallory.

SHOT has zoomed back to reveal that both Simon and Norman are in
wheelchairs (their legs maimed or gone).

SIMON
Yes.

NORMAN
Yes.

WAYNE
How can you say that you 'admire' them?

NORMAN
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are
standing in a dark room waiting for the
other to attack. These two people
can't see each other, yet they know
they're there. Now, they can either
stand in the dark room forever waiting
until they die of boredom, or one of
them can make the first move.

WAYNE
Why can't they just shake hands and be
friends?

NORMAN
They can't because neither knows if the
other is a deranged senseless killer
like the Knoxs. So, you may as well
make the first move.

WAYNE
And they made the first move?

NORMAN
Unfortunately, yes.

SIMON
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.

WAYNE
Why?

SIMON
They passed the 'edge' along to us.

WAYNE
How so?

SIMON
By taking away our legs. Now we have
to fight harder to get ahead than
anyone else you'll find in this gym.
Probably the whole city. They gave us
the fighting spirit. Before this
happened I was content. Now I'm pissed
off. Now I'm half a man and I've got
to work like the devil to get whole
again.

WAYNE
But you'll never be whole again.

SIMON
Never is a very long time, Wayne. A
word only the weak use. I'm not a sore
loser. Even if I don't have a leg to
stand on, I'm going to get up and fight
this world until I'm on top again.

NORMAN
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.

SIMON
That's the way of the world.

NORMAN
They're shocking the world into
remembering the primal law.

SIMON
Survival of the fittest.

WAYNE
One last question. Usually Mickey and
Mallory kill all of their victims. Why
did they let you two survive?

The brothers pause, then turn to Wayne.

NORMAN
They had us tied down during one of
their house raids, you've seen the
headlines, and they were taking a
chainsaw to our legs before they were
gonna kill us.

SIMON
Just for fun, I guess.

NORMAN
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says,
'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'

SIMON
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says,
'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'

NORMAN
Apparently, they've seen all our films.

SIMON
They were especially influenced by
'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'

NORMAN
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took
off.

SIMON
They actually apologized.

INT. WAYNE'S STUDIO - DAY

Wayne talks.

WAYNE
The couple proved so popular that a
motion picture glamorizing their
exploits was made...

INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

Wayne enters an editing room where filmmaker NEIL POPE is
working at a movieola.

WAYNE (V.O.)
We talked with Neil Pope, writer and
director of 'Thrill Killers' for his
take on the Mickey and Mallory
phenomena.

Pope stops the movieola, turns toward the CAMERA, and greets
Wayne M.O.S.

CUT INTO INTERVIEW:

NEIL POPE
It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory
Knox are a cultural phenomena that
could only exist in our sexually
repressed society. A flower that could
only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food
culture. A what I tried to do with
'Thrill Killers' was trace the root of
the problem all the way down the vine
to the original bad seed. Yet amidst
the violence and murder and carnage,
you've got the structure of a Wagnerian
love story.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

In a back alley, the conclusion of 'Thrill Killers' plays out.
The sound of SIRENS and CHOPPERS are nearing. Movie Mickey,
shotgun in hand, runs down the alley stopping at a dumpster,
where the wounded and bloody Movie Mallory sits propped up
against a brick wall. On the bottom of the SCREEN, the
subtitle appears: SCENE FROM 'THRILL KILLERS' (1990).

MOVIE MALLORY
Mickey, honey, listen to me.

Movie Mallory holds out her hand for him to take it. He does.

MOVIE MALLORY
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.

MOVIE MICKEY
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt,
but--

MOVIE MALLORY
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really
want to. If I could, I would, but I
can't. I gotta stay here. But you can
still get out of here.

MOVIE MICKEY
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!

MOVIE MALLORY
If they stay, they'll catch you, and
they don't have to catch you---

MOVIE MICKEY
No fuckin' way!

MOVIE MALLORY
Mickey, you're wasting time!

MOVIE MICKEY
I don't give a damn if a million United
States marines, all whistling the halls
of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin'
down this alley any second. There
ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm
leaving you. And that's that!

Movie Mallory grabs his hand with both of hers. She's crying.

The SIREN and CHOPPER sounds are getting closer.

MOVIE MALLORY
Mickey, my love, if you leave me,
they'll catch me and take me to the
hospital. If you stay, you'll make 'em
kill you. Then it'd be like I killed
you. I could bear anything, but I
couldn't bear that. So please, please,
for me, my handsome
husband, run for your life.

The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer.

MOVIE MICKEY
I can't do it. You're my wife, you're
my partner. A fella doesn't run when
his partner can't run with him.
Mallory, my angel, if I could of left
ya, I'd of left ya a long time ago.

They kiss.

MOVIE MALLORY
Well, hell, if you won't leave, give me
a gun so I can go out shooting.

Movie Mickey hands her his .44 Magnum from his belt.

MOVIE MICKEY
Sit tight. I'm gonna make it a little
tougher for 'em.

Movie Mickey runs to the end of the alley, peers around the
corner at the arriving COPS.

MOVIE MICKEY
(to himself)
Time to get naked and boogie.

Movie Mallory is out of movie Mickey's view. She cocks the .44,
then places the barrel under her chin.

MOVIE MALLORY
Mickey!

Movie Mickey's busy. He doesn't turn around.

MOVIE MICKEY
Yeah baby.

MOVIE MALLORY
You made every day like kindergarten.

Movie Mallory pulls the trigger. BANG!

DOLLY down the alley to a CU on Mickey as he spins around.

Movie Mallory literally blew her head clean off. Her headless
body, gun in hand, remains upright in her sitting position.

Movie Mickey runs toward her, screaming her name in SLOW MOTION.

MOVIE MICKEY
Mallory!

CUT TO:

BACK TO: THE POPE INTERVIEW

WAYNE (O.S.)
Why did you kill Mallory? Both of
them are still alive.

NEIL POPE
It was dramatic license, no doubt. But
I felt an operatic love story needed an
operatic ending. The two of them kill
for each other. They offer the death
of their victims to each other like
other lovers offer flowers or bon bons.
So what more natural, what more
organic, what more poetic than Mallory
offering her death to Mickey? It's
where it's been leading since day one.
We worked it in the movie by using a
what if they escaped situation. I
think it works beautifully. You'd be
surprised. People come up to me at the
end of the movie in tears.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Actor JESSIE ALEXANDER WARWICK sits on his motorcycle and talks
to the CAMERA. He's dressed in a Levi's jacket, jeans, a bandanna
is wrapped around his head, and as he talks he bogarts a smoke.
His name appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

JESSIE
One thing about Mickey for sure, he's
definitely a man who has his moments.
It was wild playin' him. It was one of
those get-it-out-of-your-system
performances.

INT. BUFFY ST. MCQUEEN'S HOME - DAY

This interview is SHOT in Buffy's house a'la Barbara Walters.
BUFFY sits on the couch in her living room with a cat in her
lap. From time to time, she sips from a coffee cup. Her name
appears at the bottom of the SCREEN.

BUFFY
I didn't play Mallory, the murderer. I
didn't play her as a butcher. I played
her as a woman in love, who also
happens to murder people. I didn't
want her to be at arm's length from the
audience or myself. If you play her as
this wild maniac, the audience never
has to deal with her. If you see a
decapitation in a movie, you just say
'Oh wow, a neat special effect.'
Because you can't relate to a
decapitation. It doesn't mean anything
to anybody because it's not personal.
Decapitations don't fall into most
people's realm of life experiences.
But if you show somebody in a movie
getting a paper cut, the whole audience
squirms. Because everybody can relate
to a paper cut.

WAYNE (O.S.)
Did you meet the real Mallory Knox?

BUFFY
I tried to, but she wouldn't see me.
But I read some letters she wrote to
Mickey before the murder spree. They
helped me out a lot.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Jessie talks to CAMERA.

WAYNE (O.S)
You met Mickey Knox, didn't you?

JESSIE
Yeah, I visited him when he was up in
Susanville. He's a little cerebral for
my taste, but all in all, we got along.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Wayne, sitting in a chair in front of a desk, interviews DR.
REINGHOLD, who sits behind the desk.

WAYNE (V.O.)
To get a psychiatric view on the
strange attraction Mickey and Mallory
seems to have, we talked with Doctor
Emil Reinghold, noted psychologist and
author.

Wayne begins his interview.

WAYNE
Can you shed some light, Doctor
Reinghold, on why the public has taken
a pair of sociopaths so close to their
bosom?

DR. REINGHOLD
Well, for one, the media has done a
tremendous job of turning the husband
and wife mass murderers into
celebrities. But it's the country's
youth who have turned the couple into
the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,
the very thing that makes them most
lethal is the exact same thing that
captures the public's hearts and
minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic
devotion to each other. In a world
where people can't seem to make the
simplest relationships work and the
slightest emotional commitment is
considered devastating, Mick and
Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a
Shakespearean magnitude. To the
country's youth, 75 percent of which
are coming from broken homes, that's
appealing. They have an 'us against
the world' posture which always appeals
to youth. And they've taken that
posture seventeen steps beyond.
It's not 'us against the world,' it's
'we're gonna kill the world.' They're
exciting. I read their file and I find
myself turning the page like it was a
paperback. Why do disillusioned youths
get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do
disillusioned housewives read romance
novels? Why are you filming this
special? Because you know as well as I
do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles
Manson speaks,' everybody's going to
tune in to hear what he says. Mickey
and Mallory have shocked a country numb
with violence. They've created a world
where only two exist and anybody who
inadvertently enters that world is
murdered.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

MULBERRY. CAMERA moves in CU of the photo.

WAYNE (V.O.)
Of the six teens murdered that night,
seventeen year old Grace Mulberry was
the lucky one left to tell the tale.
And this haunted young lady summoned up
the courage to take the stand, tell
what she saw that horrible night, and
then allow herself to be cross-examined
by the man who killed her brother and
girlfriends.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

All kinds of PEOPLE are gathered around. It's a real media

Grace's sedan pulls up to the courthouse. The many spectators
and reporters surround the car.

Grace, HER FATHER, and BISBING emerge from the sedan, and start
walking up the courthouse steps.

Microphones and cameras are thrust at her as REPORTERS ask
questions.

Grace is afraid to face the crowd. Her head darts in the
direction of each question, but she doesn't answer.

She remains silent and scared.

FEMALE ORIENTAL REPORTER
Miss Mulberry! How does it feel to be
the only survivor of Mickey and
Mallory's reign of terror?

FAT MALE REPORTER
Miss Mulberry! Has the experience
marked you?

Some scruffy TRANSIENT sticks his head in Grace's face.

TRANSIENT
Did ya watch your brother get stabbed
up?

WAYNE
How do you feel about Mickey cross-
examining you?

Grace, her father, and Bisbing shove their way through the
crowd. After Grace and her entourage enter the courthouse, we
hear the cry of:

VOICE (O.S.)
Mickey and Mallory!

CAMERA whips toward the bottom of the steps as the car carrying
Mickey and Mallory pulls up. The reporters race down the steps
they just raced up. The Mickey and Mallory fans go apeshit.

Mickey and Mallory, handcuffed, are being led up the steps by
SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Wayne Gayle and other reporters film them
and shoot out questions. Microphones are thrust into their
faces.

WAYNE
Mickey, how do you feel about cross-
examining Grace Mulberry?

MICKEY
I'm keen with anticipation.

FEMALE ORIENTAL REPORTER
What do you think of this turn out,

No further questions, your honor.

Emotional pause, the silence.

Grace. I'd like to talk to you about
your murdered brother Tim, if you feel
up to it.

MICKEY (O.S.)
Did you get along?

Mickey waits for an answer that doesn't come.

MICKEY
Miss Mulberry?

Back to Grace.

GRACE
More or less.

MICKEY
More or less...

BACK TO: Mickey.

MICKEY
What do you mean by that?

BACK TO: Grace.

GRACE
Well, he's my older brother. When we
were growing up, there were times we
could of very well done without each
other. But when it counted, we were
close.

CU of Bisbing listening. Grace is doing better than she
thought.

CAMERA PANS from shadows to find Mickey, the pan continues
through his line.

MICKEY
I'd like to talk about Tim's martial
arts abilities. How long had he been
studying?

PAN CONTINUES back into the shadows, then 180 degrees to find Grace.

GRACE
He started when he was in the seventh
grade, so that would make it nine
years.

PAN CONTINUES back into shadows, then...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

CAMERA PANS from darkness and locks on a CU of Mickey.

MICKEY
When you study the martial arts, they
give out belts that come in different
colors to signify what level you're at
in your training. Am I correct on that
point?

GRACE
Yes you are.

MICKEY
What was the color of Tim's belt?

GRACE
The style of fighting that Tim studied
didn't believe in belts.

MICKEY
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace,
could you tell us what form of martial
arts it was that Tim was schooled in?

GRACE
Tim studied several styles, but his
favorite was Jeet Kune Do.

MICKEY
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research
on that form of fighting, and I found
out that Jeet Kune Do was a style
developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know
that?

GRACE
Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it.
Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting
style.

CU of COURT CLERK'S HANDS typing in SLOW MOTION.

MICKEY
Now, while I freely admit total
ignorance on the subject, I have heard
of Bruce Lee. And I was under the
impression that Bruce Lee was one of
the, if not the greatest fighter in the
history of martial arts.

GRACE
That's what Tim said.

MICKEY
So, I think it would be safe to say
that anybody who studied the fighting
style that Bruce Lee, arguably the
greatest martial artist of all times,
developed for nine years, that would be
a fella who could defend himself.
Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?

GRACE
Yes, I would.

Mickey points at Grace with the pencil in his hand.

MICKEY
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands
registered as lethal weapons?

GRACE
Yes, they were.

CU of Mickey's hand holding the pencil.

MICKEY
That means his hands are considered a
weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I
correct on that point?

GRACE
Yes, you are.

CU of Mallory cracking a slight smile.

MICKEY
Yet, in your testimony just now, you
described that Tim...

CAMERA moves into a tight CU of Grace. Her eyes widen.

MICKEY (O.S.)

BISBING
Objection, defence is intimidating the
witness with the murder weapon.

JUDGE STEINSMA (O.S.)
Sustained. Mr. Knox, put the knife
down.

Mickey is locked on Grace.

MICKEY (cont'd)
--had little to no defence.

GRACE
(yelling)
I don't know how you did it, but you
did it!

JUDGE STEINSMA
Mr. Knox! The knife!

Mickey glances to the judge, then slowly places the knife back
on the table.

MICKEY
How do you think a human being could
possibly be capable of doing something
like that?

Mickey locks eyes with eyes.

GRACE
(yelling)
I don't know!

Mickey is on top of her.

MICKEY
Now...I don't believe that Grace. I
think you have a definite opinion on
how I was able to do those things you
described. Now, I'm going to ask you
again. And I want you to remember you
are under oath.

Grace collects herself.

MICKEY (O.S.)
In your opinion, Miss Mulberry, how was
I able to murder you brother Tim
Mulberry in the manner you described.

The Judge looks down at Grace.

Grace looks back into her open palm. CU of the ring.

You're not human.

Mickey smiles.

GRACE
I thought about it a lot. And the only
thing I could figure is that you're not
human.

Bisbing hides her disappointment by looking down.

Mickey straightens up as Grace continues.

GRACE
You're a vampire, or the devil, or a
monster, or cyborg, or something like
that. But you're not human.

Grace breaks down. Putting her hands to her head to stop the
pain.

Mickey, dressed in county blues, is led out of the courtroom by
sheriffs deputies. He's cuffed hand and leg. Reporters throw
out questions, photographers shoot photos, Mickey is somewhere
else, no mugging to the crowd this time.

WAYNE (V.O.)
After the deadly brewhaha in the
courtroom, the judge, honorable Burt
Steinsma, passed down a sentence that
was to make legal history.

INT. JUDGE'S DEN - DAY

Interview with Judge Steinsma in his den at home.

M.O.S. SHOT of Wayne and Judge talking.

WAYNE (V.O.)
We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at
his home in Baltimore, Maryland.

The interview:

WAYNE
Was there any vengeance on your part
with your unique sentence?

JUDGE STEINSMA
Yes, unquestionably. After they did
what they did in my court, and judge
worth his robe will tell you the same
thing. It couldn't help but affect my
decision. That's why they have judges.
We're supposed to be fair to a fault,
but when it's showtime, we have to make
a decision. That's why we don't just
input all the facts into a computer for
the appropriate punishment. I couldn't
give them the death penalty. See,
California hops back and forth on that
issue. Mickey and Mallory went to
court when it was out of favor, which
is actually good because it leaves more
room for imagination. Anybody can give
somebody the chair. When you have
someone who deserves to die and you
can't kill them, you have to be
creative. And if the bastards had let
it stand, it would of been the perfect
sentence. It hit 'em right where they
lived. Far more punishing than the
death sentence.

WAYNE
Would you please describe for our
viewers what your sentence was?

JUDGE STEINSMA
Well, in a rogue's gallery of killers,
Mickey and Mallory are very unique.
I've seen a lot of killers in my day
and they're a very cold lot. They have
no more feelings about taking a
person's life than squashing a tiny
bug. It's all the same to them. Well,
Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em
to watch their expression change'
attitude personified. Except with each
other. And, since they lived only for
each other, I wanted to attack that, at
its very root. So, in a nutshell, my
sentence was double life for each
without any possibility for parole.
That would be fairly standard in their
case. The twist I added was that the
husband and wife would have no contact
or correspondence with each other for
the rest of their lives. And they
would never receive any word or
information about the other.
So, basically once the cell door slams
shut, Mickey and Mallory will
completely disappear from each other's
life. They'll never know when the
other dies. But alas, the best laid
plans of mice and men...

mayhem that it was decided...

INSERT: FRONT PAGE NEWSPAPER: 'MICKEY AND MALLORY TO BE
TRANSFERRED TO ASYLUM.'

WAYNE (V.O.)

needed to be transferred to a state
mental hospital.

WAYNE (V.O.)
We talked with Dewight McClusky,
chairman of the California State Prison
Board, about this curious turn of
events in the Mickey and Mallory case.

INT. MCCLUSKY'S OFFICE - DAY

Wayne's interviewing McClusky.

WAYNE
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved
to an asylum? And who made the
decision?

MCCLUSKY
The prison board made the decision. A
board of which I belong. We're the
who. The why is simple. Mickey and
Mallory are mentally ill and need to be
under a doctor's care, where hopefully
they'll receive the help they need.

WAYNE
Mickey and Mallory were deemed
competent in a mental examination
before their trial. I'm confused.
What's changed?

MCCLUSKY
Well, since that time, they've killed
one person during their trail. And
since their incarceration, they've
killed one psychologist along with
several guards and inmates.

WAYNE
When they were found competent before,
they had already killed fifty people.
Other than the fact they're a
disciplinary problem, which frankly
shouldn't surprise anyone, I still
don't see where this situation is any
different then it was before. So, I
ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's
changed?

MCCLUSKY
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our
minds. We felt they were competent a
year ago. A year has passed, sir, a
year where they were under close
observation, day in and day out, and
their behaviour has led us to believe we
were wrong.

WAYNE
Who is we?

MCCLUSKY
The prison board and the doctors who
examined them.

WAYNE
Were any of the doctors who made the
first evaluation on the Knoxs mental
state asked to re-examine them?

MCCLUSKY
Using the same doctors is not common
practice.

WAYNE
I take it by your answer it was a whole
new team?

MCCLUSKY
Now that you bring it up, yes. They
were different men. I hadn't really
thought that much about it. Since many
psychiatric opinions are, by a rule,
sought out for this kind of situation.
What do you think normally happens?
The Knoxs are assigned a family
psychologist that takes care of them
throughout the rest of their lives?
The state doesn't work like that.

WAYNE (V.O.)
The two psychiatric opinions the board
sought were those of Albert
Rodriguez...

WAYNE (V.O.)
...and Dr. Felix Vargus. Both of the
good doctors, for whatever reason,
refused to be interviewed.

INT. DR. REINGHOLD'S OFFICE - DAY

Back with Dr. Reinghold. He's laughing.

DR. REINGHOLD
It's a funny situation actually. If
anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give
a damn, what the prison board is doing
would be considered an outrage. The
prison board is basically saying, 'We
can't handle these guys.' They've
moved 'em around twice since their
sentence started.
They were a handful everywhere they
went. Now the prisons they're at now
want them outta there. But no other
prison's gonna be stupid enough to take
'em. So the prison board is left
scratching their heads wondering what
they're gonna do. Well, what they
decided to do was to set up a kangaroo
medical court that found them crazy.
Then they get them transferred to
Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay
as it's referred to in the psychiatric
circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and
electro shock diet, and Mickey and
Mallory cease to be a problem to
anybody except the orderlies who clean
out the bedpans, which if you want to
see them get theirs, that's all well
and good. But there's something being
said here. Forget the immorality for a
second. Forget the corruption and the
skulduggery involved. What the board
is saying is 'we give up.' Mickey and
Mallory ran amuck in polite society.
They were put in an alternative society
and they ran amuck there, too. All the
powers that be, can't deal with these
two kids. And whatever can't be
assimilated has to be terminated.

WAYNE
So, in your opinion Mickey and Mallory
are not insane?

DR. REINGHOLD
Insane, no. Psychotic, yes. A menace
to living creatures, yes. But to
suggest that they're insane gives the
impression that they don't know right
from wrong. Mickey and Mallory know
the difference between right and wrong.
They just don't give a damn.

Keep the girls, keep the long hairs,

And cut the interview with the prison
board fellow before that. Cut it after
I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was

specified, the SHOTS stay in Scott's CAMERA.

Scott's filming the back of the newsvan. Roger's sitting in the
back eating donuts as is Wayne. Unruly Julie's up front
driving.

WAYNE
(with mouthful of donut)
How's it working, Scotty?

SCOTT (O.S.)
Perfecto!

Roger's picking through a box of donuts. Scott PANS over to
him, then slowly ZOOMS in on him.

ROGER
Where the fuck's the chocolate cream
filled? Did anyone get my chocolate
cream filled? If you did, it's mine.

CU of Roger, looking into CAMERA.

ROGER
I pointed at a chocolate cream filled.
You saw me do it, didn't you?

Wayne starts talking. We PAN from Roger to a CU of Wayne.

WAYNE
You were there. Did you see him put it
in a box?

We PAN back to a CU of Roger.

ROGER
At the time, I was too busy explaining
to Scott the finer points of film.

We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT.

SCOTT (O.S.)
Yeah, right. You know what he said?
He said, Indiana Jones And The Temple
Of Doom is Spielberg's best film.

Wayne starts laughing. We hear Scott laugh too.

WAYNE
(to Roger)
You can't be serious?

ROGER
(preoccupied)
I'm as serious about that as I am about
going back to the donut store, and
dipping that stupid Mexican's head into
the batter for forgetting my chocolate
cream filled. Gimme that other box.

WAYNE
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.

ROGER
That dumbass probably put my chocolate
cream filled in there by mistake.

WAYNE
Roger, no.

ROGER
What's the big deal? Take out my
chocolate cream filled, put one of
these roasted coconut---

WAYNE
Roger, do you understand what the word
'no' means? It's important we
establish a rapport. Something as
simple as a dozen donuts can mean the
world to somebody who hasn't had a
donut in a year.

ROGER
So you're giving a man who butchers
whole families, little babies included,
my chocolate cream filled?

Unruly Julie HONKS the horn. Wayne gets up and looks out the
windshield.

WAYNE
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County
Jail. Julie, just park in the front.

ROGER
Wayne---

WAYNE
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed.
Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and
gather your gear.

The van stops. Wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.

EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY

BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

Wayne hops out of the van and is approached by Superintendent
Phil Wurlitzer who's followed by two DEPUTY SHERIFFS.

WAYNE
(aside to Scott)
Here's the welcome wagon.

Wurlitzer reaches them and shakes Wayne's hand.

WURLITZER
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer.
We talked on the phone. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

WAYNE
Same here. Let me introduce my crew.
Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie
...this is...I'm sorry. What's
your title again?

WURLITZER
I'm the superintendent here at L.A.
County Jail. Me and my deputies are
who you'll be working with while you're
here.

WAYNE
That sounds great. Look, I don't want
any of this to intimidate you. This is
not going to be a big deal. This is
going to be very easy.
(to his crew)
I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You
guys get your equipment ready, power up
the van and confirm a transmission code
for the remote. Julie come with me.

Julie tosses the keys to Roger and shadows Wayne as he speaks
confidentially to Wurlitzer.

WAYNE
The main thing I need is a big room,
shut off from the population, so we can
get some privacy...with a few
electrical outlets.

INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

Wayne and his crew have set up in the food supply room off from
the cafeteria. Being big, roomy, and unpopulated, it's perfect
for an interview. There's eight L.A. County DEPUTY SHERIFFS
around the room along with Wurlitzer. Roger's setting up his
sound equipment while Unruly Julie is checking her notebook.

Wurlitzer and a few Deputies talk among themselves. CAMERA
moves from person to person without cutting.

WURLITZER
(to two Deputies)
This is just for an interview, I was
on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard' once.
It was a much bigger deal than this.
They had a crew of maybe seventy-five
people.

CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott.

WAYNE
We're gonna be talking over here. But
I want enough freedom so if I wanna get
up and move around, we can.

Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left.

WAYNE
Take him and walk him over this way.
(pretending Scott's
Mickey)
So, Mickey, killing Mallory's parents,
what the hell was that all about?
(pauses--to Scott)
Then maybe take him to the window.

He walks Scott to the window.

WAYNE
(pretending Scott's
Mickey)
So, Mickey, if you were let outta jail
today, what's the first thing you'd do?
(pause--to Scott)
Little shit like that. I don't wanna
have to feel I gotta stay in the
chairs. We're after a cinema verite,
anything can happen, truth twenty-four
times a second kindda feel.

End of single SHOT.

Wurlitzer's talking with Deputies.

WURLITZER
And when it's lunch time, they don't
just go to McDonalds. They got cooks
there servin' great food. Swedish
meatballs...

Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies.

WURLITZER
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?

WAYNE
Everything's coming along just fine.
Phil, I wanted to know if I could have
a small word with you.

WURLITZER
By all means.

Wayne puts his hand on Wurlitzer's shoulder. They walk around
the room.

WAYNE
You met the kids I have working for me?
Great bunch, aren't they?

WURLITZER
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.

WAYNE
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger,
magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I
could sooner do without my arm than
Unruly Julie.

WURLITZER
Is that her real name?

WAYNE
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're
my kids and they're all I need. After
working together these past coupla
years, we're like well-oiled machinery.
No, more like a Formula race car. No,
scratch that one, too. What we're
really like is a Swiss watch. Small,
intricate, compact...it shouldn't
work as well as it does, but it does.
Because of the craftsmanship, the
expertise, and the artist's loving
hand.

Wayne gives Wurlitzer a moment to digest this.

WURLITZER
I see.

WAYNE
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever
been on a set before---

WURLITZER
(proudly)
Ya know, I was.

WAYNE
(acting surprised)
Really?

WURLITZER
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set
about eight years ago.

WAYNE
(still acting surprised)
Well...small world. Well, then, you
know firsthand how Hollywood does
things. Lights all over the place,
generators, a hundred and fifty crew
members---

WURLITZER
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there
was probably ninety-five people there,
maybe more.

WAYNE
See what I mean? It's a funny
business, isn't it?

WURLITZER
It sure is.

WAYNE
They got a asshole over here.
(pointing to his left)
A asshole sitting down reading a
magazine over there.
(points to his right)
A asshole perched up there.
(points straight up)
Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we
were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang
stuff we'd need all those assholes,
too. What we're about is intimacy.
We're about two people having a
conversation. Say I was interviewing
you. All I want you to worry about is
what I ask you. I want a trust to
develop. If you're thinking about all
this...
(indicates the hustle and
bustle of a set)
...you're not going to relax, a trust
won't develop, we'll be talking a each
other instead of to each other, there
will be no chance for intimacy.

Wayne gives Wurlitzer a chance to take this in.

WAYNE
That's why my crew is only three...an
invisible three.
(switching gears)
Which brings me to what I wanted to
talk to you about. I have to get
Mickey Knox to relax...Mickey Knox to
share what he's never shared before...
Mickey Knox to open doors which 'till
today have been closed. Well, how can
we expect him to do that when we got
Los Angeles County Sheriffs up
the walls.

Suddenly, things get short between the two men.

WURLITZER
(snorts)
Well, just what the hell do you expect
me to do?

WAYNE
Lose 'em.

WURLITZER
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest
idea how dangerous Knox is?

WAYNE
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very
familiar with Mickey Knox's career.

They're out and out angry.

WURLITZER
Since he and his wife have been in
custody, they've killed---

WAYNE
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure
I know 'em better than you do.

WURLITZER
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you
obviously don't know. If I were to
take my men away, Mickey Knox would
snap your neck like a twig.

WAYNE
One...I can take care of myself. I
grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and
I've handled some pretty rough
customers in my day. Mickey Knox
doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a
journalist, and I'm prepared to take
that risk. Three...it ain't gonna
happen. Believe me when I tell you, it
is in Mickey Knox's own best interest
to play this game according to Hoyle.
(pause)
Wait a minute. We've gotten into a
advisory relationship here, which is
not what I want.
(pause)
But seriously, Phil, look at this.

Wayne scans the room, counting the deputy sheriffs.

WAYNE
(counting)
We got one...two...three...four
...five...six...seven...eight.
I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too
much. Let's lose some of these guys.

WURLITZER
Wayne, if it was anybody else---

WAYNE
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam
up on me with all these sheriffs all
over the place. They hate him. He
hates them. What kinda intimacy am I
gonna create with all this hate in the
air. Even you and I feel it.

WURLITZER
What are we talking about?

WAYNE
Two guys?

WURLITZER
Okay. I'll take two guys off.

WAYNE
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two
guys.

WURLITZER
I can't do that. Five guys.

WAYNE
Three.

WURLITZER
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but
that's it.

INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

Mickey lays on his bed with his hands behind his head.

CAMERA DOLLIES BACK to include the bars of Mickey's cell door in
the F.G. as two DEPUTY SHERIFFS enter FRAME and slide it open.
The deputies each carry shotguns and a shit load of chains and
shackles.

DEPUTY #1
On your feet! Turn your face to the
wall.

Mickey gets up.

MICKEY
Now what you're supposed to say is:
'Five minutes, Mr. Knox.'

OFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed.

CUT TO:

INT. MALLORY'S CELL - DAY

CU of Mallory asleep in her bunk. The echo of Mickey's cell
door makes her up with a jolt.

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
Rise and shine, Mallory!

Mallory springs out of bed, and into a fighting stance.

CAMERA WHIP PANS to Scagnetti, inside her cell, flanked by two
deputies with shotguns. The deputies are BINGHAM and
WASHINGTON.

SCAGNETTI
Beautiful day for a drive, isn't it?

CUT TO:

INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

CU of Mallory's bare feet walking in front of Bingham and
Washington's shiny black shoes.

The SOUND of Mallory's bare feet slapping the concrete floor,
along with the clip-clop-clip-clop of the deputies' shoes,
reverberates throughout the scene.

Mallory walks slightly ahead of the two shotgun wielding
deputies, when Scagnetti slips in beside her. He lights up a
cigarette with his Zippo, and talks a long drag.

SCAGNETTI
It's a long trip to Bakersfield. Long
and hot. Ever been to Bakersfield?

Mallory looks straight ahead.

SCAGNETTI
See, I've been there twice. And I'm
not lookin' forward to goin' back. But
I'm in and out. You, on the other
hand, sweetheart, are gonna spend the
rest of your life there. Now that's
what I call cruel and inhuman
punishment.

Mallory shows no emotion, just keeps on walking.

SCAGNETTI
Course you're not gonna give a shit.
'Cause when the good doctor's get
through givin' you the zap...
(he puts his finger next
to his temple, pantomimes
being electrocuted)
...You won't know where the hell you
are. They'll just put you on a window
sill, and water you every other day.

Mallory lets out a big yawn.

INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

Wayne stands at the window speaking to Scott, Roger and Unruly
Julie. One the other side of the room Wurlitzer and his
entourage of deputies are yucking it up, and occasionally
bursting into laughter.

WAYNE
(to his crew)
And when he gets here, its no dick'n
around time. Make him up, clip a mike
on him, then leave him alone. I don't
want you talking to him. I don't want
you getting in his face. I want you
hiding behind your gear. You are
invisible.

CAMERA PANS to the door as two deputies lead Mickey into the
supply room. Mickey is shackled head to toe, it's a wonder how
he can still walk.

WAYNE
(to his crew)
Okay, break.

Wayne's team disburses.

WURLITZER
Okay, boys, lets start undoing him.

Two deputies hold shotguns to Mickey's head, while two others
start unlocking the chains. As they do, Mickey looks at Wayne.

Wayne approaches Mickey.

MICKEY
(to Wayne)
Okay now, before we get started here,
there's a few things we have to get
clear about.

WAYNE
All right, Mickey.

MICKEY
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.

CAMERA holds on Mickey standing still as the two deputies remove
the chains.

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

CAMERA is inside a holding cell fixed on the cell door. The
cell door is unlocked, then opened. The two deputies bring
Mallory inside. Scagnetti wanders in, trailing behind.

Bingham pumps his shotgun slide and places the barrel next to
Mallory's head. Washington unlocks the cuffs around Mallory's
wrists.

Mallory's silent.

Scagnetti leans up against the wall, smoking his cigarette.

BINGHAM
Turn around and face the wall!

Mallory does.

Bingham and Washington move to the door.

SCAGNETTI
Wait outside for a second, fellas.

BINGHAM
We're not supposed---

SCAGNETTI
Don't worry about it.

Bingham and Washington move outside.

Scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to Washington. Before
they can protest, Scagnetti closes the door.

Mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back
to him.

Scagnetti walks up behind her.

Mallory doesn't move.

SCAGNETTI
Want a smoke?

Mallory's steel eyes glare at Scagnetti.

SCAGNETTI
C'mon, I already lit one for you. I
know you smoke.

Mallory doesn't respond. Scagnetti takes the cigarette from his
mouth and puts it between Mallory's lips. Hold on C.U. of
Mallory.

SCAGNETTI
I was reading the file on you. You
know what it said during your
trial, whenever they put you on the
stand, no matter what they asked, your
answer was always the same...'I love
Mickey.' It also says that when they
gave you a polygraph, 'I love Mickey'
was the only thing you said that
registered as the truth.

Scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to Mallory.

SCAGNETTI
Who are you supposed to be? Squeaky
Fromme? Is that it? Is Mickey your
Charles Manson? Is Mickey Jesus? Is
that the attraction? Or does he just
got a big dick?

Scagnetti changes to Mallory's other ear.

SCAGNETTI
That's it, isn't it? Mickey's got a
big donkey dick.

Scagnetti presses closer.

SCAGNETTI
Can you remember the last time you
fucked? Huh? What I want you to do is
close your eyes and remember...
remember the last time ol' Mickey gave
you the high hard one. Are ya thinkin'
about it? Good. Remember it. Don't
ever forget it cause it ain't never
gonna happen again. Cause when they
get through with all that electroshock
shit they got lined up for you two,
Mick's dick ain't gonna be worth shit.

Mallory spits the lit cigarette unto Scagnetti's face.
Scagnetti spins her around and slaps her.

SCAGNETTI
Look. You're gonna sit here for a
couple hours while I finish up the
arrangements. The reason they picked
me to be your chaperone is they know I
won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.

Scagnetti has Mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.

SCAGNETTI
So, during our journey, if any wild
hairs spring up on your ass, you'd
better slap a muzzle on 'em! Fuck with
me, bitch, even a little bit, you're
gonna get accidentally shot!
Comprehende?

Mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive HEAD
BUTT. As we hear the CRACKING of his nose, Scagnetti lets out a
horrible scream.

EXT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

Bingham and Washington fumble with the keys to open the cell
door.

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

Bingham and Washington burst through the door to find Scagnetti
face down on the ground.

Mallory's standing, her foot pressed against the middle of
Scagnetti's back, pulling his arms behind him trying to break
his back. His body is bending like a branch, and he's
screaming.

The two deputies proceed to BEAT the shit out of her with their
shotguns.

Scagnetti rolls around in the B.G., holding his bloody nose,
screaming.

SCAGNETTI
She broke my fucking nose! That bitch
broke my nose!

Washington comes over to him and helps him up.

SCAGNETTI
(blood down his face)
She broke my nose.

WASHINGTON
I'll fix it.

He grabs Scagnetti's nose, then SNAPS it back into place.
Scagnetti lets out another horrible scream, and hops up and down
from the pain.

When the rush of pain passes, Scagnetti brings his hands down
from his face, looking over at Mallory.

Bingham has Mallory in the corner of the cell with the shotgun
barrel placed in her mouth.

CU on Scagnetti. He's a hand grenade with the pin pulled.

SCAGNETTI
Hold her, boys.

Scagnetti walks to the corner where Mallory is. The shotgun
barrel's out of her mouth. Bingham and Washington stand on
either side of her, holding her in place.

Scagnetti grabs a can of mace from Washington's belt, and brings
it up to Mallory's face.

Mallory and Scagnetti trade looks.

Scagnetti gives her an intense blast of mace right in the face,
eyes, and all over her body.

Mallory crumples to the floor, screaming in agony.

TWO SHOT of Bingham and Washington looking down at Mallory on
the ground. We can hear Scagnetti still spraying her. They
can't look at this anymore.

Mallory wiggles on the floor as Scagnetti continues spraying her
all over her body.

CU of Scagnetti's bloody face smiling. We hear the SOUND of the
can of mace running empty. It spurts to a stop.

Scagnetti rises up to the two deputies. He hands the empty can
back to Washington.

SCAGNETTI
I want this filled before we leave.

The three men walk out of the holding cell, closing and locking
the door behind them. We can still hear Mallory's screams of
excruciating pain.

INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

Mickey's sitting in a chair eating a donut. Roger's attaching a
microphone to his shirt. Unruly Julie's applying make-up to
Mickey's face.

MICKEY
(to Unruly Julie)
How come you never talk?

ROGER
She was born without a tongue.

MICKEY
(repulsed)
Oh my God!
(to Unruly Julie)
Sorry.

Unruly Julie shrugs her shoulders like 'what are you gonna do' and
continues applying make-up.

Wayne and Wurlitzer talk.

WAYNE
So we got a deal. Four deputies---

WURLITZER
And me.

WAYNE
Why don't we make it three deputies and
you?

WURLITZER
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back
into his cell and we can forget the
whole thing?

WAYNE
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and
you, I can live with that. We're about
ready to go here, so let's get rid of
these other assholes.

WURLITZER
Don't call my men assholes.

WAYNE
I didn't mean they were assholes. I
mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta
here.

Wayne leaves Wurlitzer and goes over to Scott, who's setting up
a light stand.

WAYNE
Okay, Scotty, we're stuck with four of
these assholes. Now I want to create
the illusion that this is just Mickey
and I chewin' the fat all by ourselves.
So make sure you don't film these
assholes. I don't want to see 'em on
film ever. Oh, and 'Live at Five'
slated our spot as human interest which
means we'll go live at just after
five-thirty.

Wayne exits to reveal Mickey in B.G.

Wurlitzer's speaking with his four deputies.

WURLITZER
This asshole's tryin' to tell me what
I'm gonna do in my jail. Fuck him!
This nanderfuck doesn't know what he's
dealin' with here, but we do. And if
shit happens, he ain't gonna be
responsible, we are. So keep your
shotguns out, your fingers on the
triggers, and be ready to fire at a
moment's notice.

BACK TO: Mickey alone in FRAME, sitting in a chair and eating a
donut. He takes a big bite.

ROGER
Say something.

MICKEY
(mouthful of donut)
What?

ROGER
Anything.

Mickey swallows the bite of donut, pauses, then recites a poem.

MICKEY
(talking in rhyme)
I stand amid the roar
Of a surf tormented shore,
As I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand--
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep--while I weep!
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?

Mickey bites into the donut.

MICKEY
(mouthful of donut)
How was that?

Roger joins him in FRAME and adjusts the mike.

ROGER
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment
here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n
roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the
donut place put a chocolate cream
filled I asked for in your box.

MICKEY
There's a chocolate cream filled in
there?

ROGER
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.

MICKEY
Tough titty, it's mine now.

ROGER
Look, I'll trade you.

Wayne enters frame.

WAYNE
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts!
What did I tell you. Stop bothering
Mickey, and get behind your nagra.

ROGER
(to himself)
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you
doing? You're bothering the serial
killer.

Roger exits FRAME.

Wayne grabs a chair and sets it in front of Mickey.

WAYNE
Sorry about that.

MICKEY
Don't worry about it.

WAYNE
We're about ready to go here. Are you
ready?

MICKEY
Let's do it.

Wayne smiles and exits FRAME.

WAYNE (O.S.)
Okay people! Let's start to settle
down here.

CUT TO:

INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

16mm - BLACK & WHITE

SCENE is now SHOT through Scott's CAMERA which holds a ECU of
Mickey's eye.

CAMERA focuses then pulls out to include his whole face.

WAYNE (O.S.)
Are you comfortable?

Mickey looks to Wayne OFF SCREEN and nods.

WAYNE (O.S.)
Roger?

ROGER (O.S.)
Rockin'!

WAYNE (O.S.)
Scotty?

SCOTT (O.S.)
Rollin'...and speed!

WAYNE (O.S.)
Slate it.

CAMERA SLATE reading 'KNOX INTERVIEW -- ROLL #1' is thrust into
view and clapped. The CAMERA ZOOMS out to include Wayne in the
FRAME.

WAYNE
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for
fun.

MICKEY
Aside from the obvious?

Mickey breaks out laughing.

WAYNE
(not amused)
Yes. Aside from the obvious.

Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course.

MICKEY
Okay, let me see now. What do I do for
fun?
(to people O.S.)
Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are
drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes.
(to camera)
Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just
sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies
smokin' up a storm, and it's really
doin' it to me.

A deputy comes into FRAME, hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights
it. Deputy exits FRAME.

MICKEY
Much obliged. What do I do for fun?
Do you want to know what I do for fun
or what I did for fun?

WAYNE
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun
for starters.

MICKEY
What I did for fun for starters.
(thinking)
Well, something I used to do...always
was a lot of fun...
(pause)
No, scratch that. Let me think of
something else. In fact, why don't we
come back to that question. Ask me
something else.

WAYNE
Do you miss Mallory?

MICKEY
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my
wife. I haven't seen her in a long
time. What a stupid question.

WAYNE
Then was it worth it?

MICKEY
Was what worth it?

WAYNE
Was massacring all those people worth
being separated from your wife for the
rest of your life?

Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette.

MICKEY
Do you think up these questions or the
girl with no tongue?

WAYNE
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away
with that shit. Answer the question.
Was it worth it? You haven't seen,
heard, or smelled Mallory in a year.
Was it worth it?

MICKEY
Was an instant of purity worth a
lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.

WAYNE
Excuse me, did you say an instant of
purity? What was the instant of
purity? The bodies you left behind on
your bloody trail?

MICKEY
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a
big, big, big part. But it's only the
chorus, it's not the whole song.

WAYNE
(passionately)
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's
the purity that you couldn't live
without in five year old Danny
Millhouse's blown off head? Where's
the purity in forty-eight people who
are no longer on this planet because
they met you and Mallory? What's so
fucking pure about that?

CAMERA ZOOMS in on Mickey's face. Mickey looks at Wayne, takes
a slow drag off his cigarette.

MICKEY
Where the purity comes into play---

The image on the SCREEN starts to flutter, and then jams.

WHITE LEADER fills the SCREEN.

SCOTT (V.O.)
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.

WAYNE (V.O.)
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that
thought. Reload, quick!

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

We're back to COLOR 35mm.

WHITE LEADER FADES to reveal the wall of the holding cell.
CAMERA pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her
face from the holding cell toilet. The pain has started to
subside.

All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings:

MALLORY
(singing)
Love is a hurtin' thang,
and it leaves a fiery sting.

SCOTT (V.O.)
Okay. Okay, we're up again.

WAYNE (V.O.)
Roll it. Save the slate.

CUT TO:

INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

16MM - BLACK & WHITE

We're looking through Scott's CAMERA again on a new roll of
film.

WAYNE
You just said an instant of purity was
preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't
understand. What's so pure about
forty-eight dead bodies?

MICKEY
You'll never understand. Me and you,
Wayne, we're not even the same species.
I used to be you...then I evolved.
From where you're standing, you're a
man. From where I'm standing, you're a
ape. I'm here...I'm right here...
and you...you're somewhere else, man.
You say why? I say why not?

WAYNE
Tell me about the purity.

MICKEY
(laughing)
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and
a smoke only get you so far. You're
gonna have to do your job.

WAYNE
(laughs)
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll
move on and come back later.

MICKEY
I'm sure we will.

WAYNE
Describe Mallory.

MICKEY
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty,
she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two
feet, two hands, ten fingers...

WAYNE
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You
know what I mean. Describe Mallory.
(points at his head)
What's up here?
(points at his heart)
What's in here?

MICKEY
That's indescribable.

WAYNE
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do
you feel about the fact that you're
never gonna see Mallory again?

MICKEY
(smiles)
Says who?

WAYNE
Says the United States of America.

MICKEY
(laughs)
When have they ever been right?

The crew laughs (O.S.)

MICKEY
Hey, just like Soupy Sales.

INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

Scagnetti walks down the hallway leading to the supply room.
His face is a patchwork of medical tape, to set his broken nose.
Bloody cotton protrudes from each nostril.

INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

Scagnetti walks into the supply room. Mickey is explaining to
Wayne 'Why he's killed all those people.' Scagnetti can't
believe what he's seeing. The entire room is in rapture.

MICKEY
...one night I was asleep, and a noise
wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit,
somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a
gun, so I go into the living room with
a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned
out to be nothing. God made the noise.
Who knows?

SCAGNETTI
(whispers)
How's it goin'?

WURLITZER
(whispers)
Shhhh! I wanna hear this.

Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti's bandaged face.

WURLITZER
What the hell happened to you?

SCAGNETTI
You should see the other bitch. What
time you got?

WURLITZER
Two-thirty. Shhh...

CAMERA leaves them and travels the room, studying the faces of
the deputies, Unruly Julie, Roger, and Wayne as they listen to
Mickey's story.

MICKEY
But I came to the direction I need a
gun. Do, the next day I started off
early for work, and I'm gonna stop by a
gun shop and pick up a little home
protection. I walked into the place
and had never seen so many guns in all
my life. So, I'm lookin' around, the
this really nice sales guy comes up to
me. His name was Warren. I'll never
forget his name. He was really nice.
Anyway, Warren showed me all these
different models of guns. Magnums,
automatics, pistols, Walters. And I
ask to see a shotgun. He brings me a
Mossberg pump action shotgun. As soon
as I held that baby in my hands, I knew
what I was gonna do. It felt so good.
It felt like it was a part of me. They
had a mirror in the store. I looked at
myself holding it, and looked so
fuckin' good, I immediately bought it.
Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo.
Turned my car around, drove to
Mallory's house, we took care of
Mallory's parents, packed up the car,
and we were off.

DISSOLVE TO:

SAME SCENE: SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

MEDIUM CU on Mickey.

MICKEY
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The
cops, my mom, everybody. But you see,
they all missed the point of the story.
I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding
the shotgun, it all became clear. I
realized for the first time my one true
calling in life. I'm a natural born
killer.

WAYNE
Okay, let's cut it.

BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

WAYNE
(to Scott)
Did ya get that?

Unruly Julie hands Wayne a notebook. He starts flipping pages.

SCOTT
It's gonna be beautiful.

WAYNE
Super cool.
(to Mickey)
This is great stuff. How ya doin'?

MICKEY
I could go for a Coke.

WAYNE
(yelling)
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?

WURLITZER
I'm not running out and getting that
piece of shit a Coke.

WAYNE
Fine.
(to Unruly Julie)
Julie, why don't you make a food run?
(to the room)
What's around here?

DEPUTY SHERIFF
There's an In and Out Burgers about a
block away on Olive. It's walking
distance.

WAYNE
Okay, Julie, take everybody's order.
I'll have a double double with cheese,
french fries, and a large Coke.

Unruly Julie writes down Wayne's order in her notebook, then
goes from person to person collecting their orders.

Scagnetti and Wurlitzer talk to each other.

WURLITZER
Are you all set?

SCAGNETTI
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready
to roll.

WURLITZER
I assigned you Bingham and Washington
to go along.

In B.G., Unruly Julie takes Scott's and Roger's orders.

SCAGNETTI
Yeah, we met. They're good men.

WURLITZER
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be
there for when ya need 'em. Where
are they?

SCAGNETTI
Waitin' in the lounge.

WURLITZER
How 'bout Mallory?

SCAGNETTI
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.

Unruly Julie walks up to the two men to take their order. In
the B.G., we hear the wall phone BUZZ.

SCAGNETTI
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.

WURLITZER
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.

Unruly Julie walks away. A deputy yells for Wurlitzer.

DEPUTY SHERIFF
Capt'n!

WURLITZER
Yeah?

The deputy holds the receiver of the wall phone in his hand.

DEPUTY SHERIFF
They need you. Emergency!

Wurlitzer rushes to the phone, grabs the receiver.

WURLITZER
(into phone)
Talk to me.
(pause)
Where?
(pause)
For the love of Pete...okay...okay
...okay. Mobilize the men. I'm on
my way.

CAMERA PANS away from Wurlitzer to the extremely curious
eavesdroppers.

CAMERA glides by all of them: Scagnetti, Wayne, Scott, Roger,
Unruly Julie, and finally ends up on Mickey.

CAMERA holds on Mickey as he contemplates Wurlitzer's
conversation.

OFF SCREEN the phone receiver being SLAMMED down.

WURLITZER (O.S.)
I'll be a son of a bitch. There's a
riot going on in the laundry room.

DEPUTY SHERIFF (O.S.)
Is it serious?

WURLITZER (O.S.)
It sure as hell is. They got guns,
hostages, and explosives.

The room reacts.

WURLITZER (O.S.)
Jack, could you stay up here for a
while?

SCAGNETTI (O.S.)
Yeah, sure.

WURLITZER (O.S.)
I'm taking one of these men. Yates,
come with me.

WAYNE (O.S.)
Could we go with you and film it?

WURLITZER (O.S.)
Stay up here and finish your interview,
I've got to see what the hell's going
on down there before I can take
responsibility for you to film there.

We hear Wurlitzer and Deputy Yates walk out.

Unruly Julie walks into FRAME next to Mickey. She has her
notebook.

MICKEY
I'll have a four by four. That's four
patty burgers. Now they don't have
that on the menu, but if you order a
four by four, they'll know what you're
talking about. A large Coke and two
orders of fries.

When she finishes writing down Mickey's order, Julie walks off
silently.

CAMERA follows Julie out the door and into...

INT. JAIL CORRIDOR - DAY

CAMERA DOLLIES with Julie as she walks down the corridor.

As DEPUTIES with shotguns and riot gear speed down the hall, the
CAMERA passes Julie and speeds down the corridor, following the
DEPUTIES into BLACKNESS.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

CAMERA PANS from blackness to WIDE ANGLE of a dark jail wall
masques with shadows of prison bars. The surreal echoing sounds
of a riot swell until...

A SHADOW of a PRISON GUARD stumbles into frame, followed by a
MOB of other SHADOWS carrying NIGHTSTICKS and BARS.

The Mob catches the Prison Guard and beat him mercilessly before
moving on.

CAMERA TILTS down to a CU of a thin stream of BLOOD crawling
across the floor.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

SHOT through Scott's CAMERA:

FOCUSING on Mickey, who's standing in a MEDIUM SHOT.

MICKEY
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?

WAYNE (O.S.)
Sure.

MICKEY
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty
funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now
in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk.
And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks
her mother if she can go out on a date.

As Mickey tells this joke, he moves around the room. Scott's
CAMERA follows.

MICKEY
The mother asks, 'Where's he taking
you?' The sister says, 'The drive-in
movie.' The mother tells her she can
only go if she takes Little Johnny with
her. She says okay. They go to the
drive-in, they come back. The mother
gets Little Johnny and says, 'Okay,
what happened? Where did ya go?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, draws a square in the air, and acts
like he's driving.

MICKEY
Mother says, 'The drive-in movie. What
did they do?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's kissing.

MICKEY
'They kissed. What else?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, starts squeezing imaginary breasts.

MICKEY
'He felt her up? What else?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, acts like he's undressing.

MICKEY
(dumbfounded)
'They took off their clothes? What
else?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's having sex.

MICKEY
'They did it? What were you doing?'

Mickey, as Little Johnny, vigorously acts as if he's jacking
off.

Everyone in the room breaks up. Wayne, the boys, the deputies,
even Scagnetti cracks a smile.

As Mickey was telling the joke, he stopped in front of Deputy #4
during the punchline.

While everybody's laughing, Mickey SLAMS his elbow in Deputy
#4's face. Mickey grabs hold of the shotgun, rips it from
Deputy #4's grasp, then BASHES him in the face three times with
the butt.

Deputy #4 drops, ugly and unconscious.

Scott's CAMERA goes wild.

BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

The other deputies react.

Mickey pumps the shotgun slide and shoots, hitting Deputy #5 in
the chest, BLOWING him off his feet. He lands on his back with
a THUD.

Deputy #3 raises his shotgun. Mickey drops to a crouching
position and FIRES, BLASTING Deputy #3 in the groin.

Deputy #3 crumples into the wall, FIRING his gun -- SLOW MOTION.

The stray bullet THUNKS Scott right in the chest, BLOWING him
out of FRAME.

Deputy #3 drops to the floor, FIRING his shotgun straight up --
SLOW MOTION.

CU of ceiling being BLASTED.

Chunks of plaster and rock rain down on Sheriff #3.

Scagnetti has whipped out his gun and is bringing it up to
fire -- SLOW MOTION.

Mickey, still crouched down, spins around toward Scagnetti --
SLOW MOTION.

Scagnetti has his gun aimed at Mickey.

Squatting, Mickey has the shotgun trained on Scagnetti.

They're positioned across from each other on opposite sides of
the room.

Nobody fires.

We DOLLY past the faces of both Wayne and Roger, who are flat on
the ground, scared to death.

CU on Scagnetti's face.

CU on Mickey's face.

CU on Scagnetti's finger putting pressure on the trigger, then
CAMERA moves up to a CU profile of his face.

OVERHEAD SHOT of Mickey. CAMERA moves down in front of him into
a CU on his face.

MICKEY
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.

SCAGNETTI
Slide the shotgun over here, put your
hands behind your head, put your
forehead on the floor.

MICKEY
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow
you in half and you know it.

SCAGNETTI
I've never wounded anything in my life.
I got you locked right between the eyes.

Mickey rises.

MICKEY
If you don't drop that toy, I'm blowin'
you in half on three. So, if you got
me locked, take the shot. One...

DOLLY in on Scagnetti's gun in F.G., past the gun, to his face.

CU of barrel of shotgun.

MICKEY (O.S.)
Two...

DOLLY continues closing in on Scagnetti's face.

Wayne watches, wide eyed.

ECU on Mickey's face.

MICKEY
Three!

MEDIUM SHOT on Scagnetti.

SCAGNETTI
Hold it! Don't shoot!

He CLICKS the hammer back into place on his gun, then points the gun up.

MICKEY
Open the chamber. Empty the shells.

Scagnetti does. The shells fall out.

The shells fall on the floor at Scagnetti's feet -- SLOW MOTION.

MICKEY
Toss it.

Scagnetti does.

MICKEY
Now put your hands behind your head.

Scagnetti does.

Mickey, holding the shotgun, walks up to Scagnetti. They stand,
facing each other.

MICKEY
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'

SCAGNETTI
What?

Mickey CLOUTS him across the face with the shotgun. Scagnetti
hits the ground. Blood coughs from his broken nose.

Mickey looks at Wayne and Roger on the ground.

MICKEY
You guys stay on your bellies.

ROGER
Yes, sir.

Mickey bends over Scagnetti and takes hold of his right hand.

MICKEY
I am the most dangerous man in the
world.

Mickey SNAPS the trigger finger on Scagnetti's right hand.

Scagnetti screams.

Mickey's still bent over Scagnetti.

MICKEY
(points at Scagnetti)
You're the law.
(points at himself)
I'm the law breaker.

Scagnetti's not going to give Mickey and more trouble.

Mickey stands straight, looks toward Wayne and Roger.

MICKEY
Donut, get your camera. See if it's
broke.

WAYNE
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.

MICKEY
Scott's dead. And unless you wanna
play follow the leader, shut up and do
as you're told.


Roger's checking the camera. He turns on the motor. It sounds
like a lawn mower.

MICKEY
How is it?

ROGER
Not good.

MICKEY
Do you have a back up.

ROGER
It's video.

MICKEY
Even better. Wayne call your station,
tell 'em we're going live a little
early today. Make it happen!

Wurlitzer steps into the BLACK FRAME. This SCENE becomes a
TRAVELLING CU that never leaves Wurlitzer. Although we'll only
see Wurlitzer, we can make out activity in the edges of the

WURLITZER
I want two men stationed in that tier,

PITNEY (O.S.)
Capt'n!

Wurlitzer walks over to a table and looks down.

PITNEY (O.S.)
Here's the layout of the laundry room.

WURLITZER
Where do the air ducts lead?

PITNEY (O.S.)
Here.

SMITHY (O.S.)
Problem is they'll hear somebody
approaching that way.

PITNEY (O.S.)
We turned off the power when they took

WURLITZER
We turn it back on. The machines go
back on supplying us with the cover
noise we need. Smithy, do it.

SMITHY (O.S.)
Right away, Capt'n.

CAMERA follows Wurlitzer as he heads another direction.

WURLITZER
Jonesy, are the sharpshooters in place?

JONESY (O.S.)
Yes.

WURLITZER
You sure?

JONESY (O.S.)
I think--

WURLITZER
Never say you think when you know, or
you know when you think.

Wurlitzer snatches a walkie talkie.

WURLITZER
(into walkie talkie)
Bergman, you in place?

BERGMAN (O.S.)
(from walkie talkie)
Sure am, Capt'n. Nothin' clean yet.

WURLITZER
(into walkie talkie)
Pass this to your team...the second
they get a lock on a blue, they're to
take the shot. Do you understand?

BERGMAN (O.S.)
(from walkie talkie)
That's a big ten-four, Capt'n.

Wurlitzer looks to his right.

WURLITZER
What do you think, Pitney? How much
Explosives do you think that they
really have in there?

PITNEY (O.S.)
It's hard to say Capt'n.

WURLITZER
Take a wild stab!

PITNEY (O.S.)
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.

WURLITZER
The entire wing?

PITNEY (O.S.)
That's my opinion.

WURLITZER

Mickey enters the FRAME with shotgun in hand, pushing Wayne out.

MICKEY
Thank you, Wayne, but our little movie

Mallory.' Starring me, you, Mallory,
and special guest accomplice, Jack-

BACK TO: COLOR 35mm

WIDE SHOT of Mickey, holding his shotgun. He walks over and
grabs the shotgun from dead Deputy #5. Deputy #5 won't let go
of the gun from his dead man's grip. Mickey finally yanks it
loose. He extracts all the shells from the gun, picks them off
the floor, and puts them in his pocket.

Mickey picks up Scagnetti's gun, inserts the loose bullets and
slips it into his pants.

MICKEY
Okay, Jack, this is what we're doing.
Stand behind me, put your back against
mine and extend your arms behind you.

Scagnetti rises, insecurely. He presses his back against
Mickey's.

MICKEY
Now if I feel your back move away from
mine, you're gonna be ripped apart.
Got it?

Scagnetti's back to back with Mickey. His arms flank Mickey.

SCAGNETTI
Yeah.

MICKEY
Okay, Wayne, step forward.

Wayne enters FRAME. Mickey extends the shotgun.

MICKEY
Keep comin'. Put your solar plexus
against the barrel.

Wayne does.

MICKEY
Grab his arms.

Wayne does and Mickey quickly binds their arms together with
gaffer's tape, forming a two man ring around him.

MICKEY
Either one of you two move, it's gonna
be shotgun city. You understand?

WAYNE & SCAGNETTI
Yes.

Mickey tucks the tape roll into his shirt.

MICKEY
You ready, Donut?

ROGER
Ready.

MICKEY
Wagons, hooaaa!

The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with
the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's
walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to
his neck.

Roger follows with the camera.

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to

MALLORY

All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it. I

The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey,
Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up
along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped
with tape.

CU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes.

MICKEY
(to Mallory)
Honey, I'm home.

Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This
kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something
everybody told them they would never do again.

For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're
enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple.

MALLORY

It's taken you so long to come to me.

WURLITZER
Wait a minute, Bailey. Where's the
list of the hostages?

BAILEY (O.S.)
I'm working on it Capt'n.

WURLITZER
Keep on it, son.

Wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces.

WURLITZER
(reading the names)
Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez,
Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos,
Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard...

Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with
his hands.

NAPALATONI (O.S.)
Capt'n.

Wurlitzer looks up, then looks back down.

WURLITZER
What is it Napalatoni?

NAPALATONI (O.S.)
Mickey Knox is loose.

Wurlitzer looks up.

WURLITZER
What do you mean he's loose?

NAPALATONI (O.S.)
He's armed, he's killed three deputies
and one of Wayne Gayle's guys. At the
moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox
in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle,
another TV guy, that cop fella, and two
other deputies as hostages. And
Capt'n, they have one of them news
cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't
stop playin' it. What do you want us
to do?

Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his
mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing
would come out. He just sits.

CUT TO:

INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against
the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly
as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken
fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is
standing, alert and ready for action.

As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger,
tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is
panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man.

Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn.

MICKEY
Okay, we're going out that door, and
we're gonna march down the hall and
right out of the building.
(to Wayne)
Donut said something about a news van.

WAYNE
Yeah, we have a van.

MICKEY
Where's it parked?

WAYNE
Out front.

MICKEY
Let me have the keys.

Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses
the keys to Mickey.

WAYNE
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

MICKEY
No.

WAYNE
This is crazy. You can't escape like
this.

MICKEY
Probably not, but we're gonna give it
the old college try.

WAYNE
We'll all be killed.

MALLORY
Exciting, isn't it?

Duncan begins to cry.

MICKEY
Now, when we get out there, you do what
we say or it's curtains. If we say
move, you move. If we say left, you
move left. If we say right, you move
right. If we say mole, you dig a hole.
Got it?

MALLORY
Are we in a big hurry?

MICKEY
You got something you want to do?

MALLORY
Yeah.

MICKEY
By all means, knock yourself out.

MALLORY
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.

Roger snaps up and hoists the camera to his shoulder.

VIDEO FOOTAGE:

Shot through Roger's CAMERA: IMAGE FOCUSES on Mallory as she
points to Scagnetti sitting on the floor.

MALLORY
You! Stand up!

Scagnetti gulps, then rises knowing that he has fucked with the
wrong woman.

Mallory walks up to him with pistol in hand.

MALLORY
You probably thought it was pretty
funny, didn't ya?

She raises Scagnetti's pistol, aiming it at its former owner.
Scagnetti flinches and squirms.

MALLORY
Can you remember the last time you
fucked with me? Close your eyes and
remember...Are ya thinking about it?
Good.

Mallory fires three shots into Scagnetti's chest.

Roger's CAMERA jumps, then follows the body to the floor. Roger
HOLDS on Scagnetti slumped on the floor.

DUNCAN (O.S.)
Oh God! Oh God! Ohhhh...

MICKEY
We're sending out a hostage. Don't
touch him!

OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open.

Roger's CAMERA whips around to witness Mickey and Mallory
jumping into the corridor, BLASTING with their guns while using
the hostages for shields. Roger's CAMERA moves out of the cell
and...

INT. JAIL CORRIDOR (OUTSIDE THE HOLDING CELL) - DAY

There are even more DEPUTY SHERIFFS in the corridor.

CROSS FIRE whistles by as Roger dodges to catch up with the
caravan.

The footage is very similar to Vietnam footage. It's shaky,
real, harsh, and it captures the pandemonium of battle.

The soundtrack is a mixture of yelling, crying, laughing,
and gunfire.

HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 is SHOT, and discarded by Mickey.

The wild caravan runs down the hallway, FIRING behind them.

Mickey's HIT, but keeps on running and FIRING. Mallory sees
this and screams.

MALLORY
Mickey!

MICKEY
Don't stop!

Roger's CAMERA runs along with them.

ROGER (O.S.)
Man, oh, man...this is better than
Vietnam!

More DEPUTIES appear at the end of the hallway.

Mickey and Mallory get back to back with each other, using
DUNCAN as a shield in front of them and Wayne behind them.
Mickey FIRES from the front, Mallory FIRES from the rear.

DUNCAN
Please don't kill me! Don't kill me...

CAMERA WHIP PANS to catch a Deputy hopping around the corner.
The SCREEN FLASHES WHITE with a BLAST.

Roger's HIT, and the CAMERA goes haywire, reeling out of
control, the THUNKING to the ground. Roger screams O.S.

CAMERA lies on the floor, video still transmitting. Roger rolls
into FRAME screaming.

MICKEY (O.S.)
Get the camera! Get the fucking
camera!

BACK TO: COLOR 35mm.

As Mickey FIRES cover for her, Mallory swipes the camera from
Roger's side.

The Knox's start running again, still holding Wayne and last
hostage.

Deputies are lying on the ground, wounded and screaming, or dead
and silent.

MICKEY
(to Mallory)
This way.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

The caravan bursts into the stairwell. Mickey turns to Duncan
the remaining hostage deputy.

MICKEY
(to Duncan)
Where does this lead?

Duncan is hyper-ventilating. Mickey pushes him against to
wall.

MICKEY
Where!?!

DUNCAN
Th-- the ground floor.

MALLORY
Is that the front door?

Duncan nods frantically.

MICKEY
Let's go.

Mickey grabs Duncan and the caravan starts running down the
stairs. They go down a few flights.

As they run down one last flight, they find Wurlitzer and a team
of DEPUTIES waiting for them on the ground floor. The deputies
raise their guns.

Mallory grabs hold of Wayne, and gets behind him with one hand
pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other
are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.

MALLORY
Back off or I'll blast him! Back off
or I'll blast him! Back off or I'll
blast him!

None of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less
likely to start shooting.

Wayne screams.

WAYNE
Don't shoot. I beg you, don't shoot!
Please, please, please...

Wayne continues begging.

Wurlitzer steps forward.

WURLITZER
Now Mickey, Mallory, just let me say---

MALLORY
Shut up! Don't talk, I don't wanna
hear it!

WURLITZER
You have to know---

MALLORY
I said shut up...

Mallory quickly lowers her gun from Wayne's head and SHOOTS him
in the thigh. She whips the gun back up to his head.

Wayne's screaming in pain.

The deputies jump back.

MALLORY
...and I mean shut up!

There's a bit of a silent standoff.

Tears are streaming down Duncan's face as the caravan slowly
retreats back up the stairs to the next flight.

The deputies hold their present position.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON STAIRWELL - DAY

The caravan goes up one flight, then stops. Mickey and Mallory
let their two hostages sit down.

Duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his
uniform.

Mickey's pacing.

MICKEY
Think...think...think...

Mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her
hand. Blood trickles out between the fingers. We see now she's
been shot.

Over Duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear Wurlitzer yelling
from below.

WURLITZER (O.S.)
Give up! There's no other way out!

Mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. Mallory sits down next to.
him. She winces in pain. He puts his arm around her.

MALLORY
Look, lover boy, we're not getting
outta here. So I say the hell with
going back to our cells. Let's do a
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
Run down these stairs shootin', go out
in a hail of bullets, but take as many
of those motherfuckers with us as
possible.

Suddenly, Mickey's exhaustion lifts. He has a plan.

MICKEY
We'll do that when all else fails.

Mickey stands.

MALLORY
Hasn't it?

MICKEY
We still got a few tricks up our
sleeves.

Mickey confronts the two hostages. He points at Duncan.

MICKEY
You married?

DUNCAN
Oh, I don't wanna die...

MICKEY
Are you married? Do you have kids?

Duncan nods pathetically.

MICKEY
Good. People, we're goin' all the way
to the front door. Now, the only way
we're gonna get there is if they don't
want to kill you two more than they
want to kill us.

INSERT:

SHOTS of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill
Mickey and Mallory. We hear Mickey's voice over this SHOT.

MICKEY (V.O.)
Right now I find that highly unlikely.
So, let's help 'em out, shall we?

BACK TO PRISON STAIRWELL:

Mickey is squatting in front of Wayne.

MICKEY
Now, say I tell those guys down there
if they shoot or make a move, I'm
killin' Wayne Gayle. And they shoot or
make a move anyway. Now say by some
freak accident, you didn't die, you
live though it. What would you do?

Mickey pulls the roll of GAFFER'S TAPE from his shirt and starts
tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.

WAYNE
What would I do? Me and my network
would sue the entire Los Angeles County
Sheriffs Department for flagrantly
disregarding my safety. I'd go
straight to my buddy, the mayor, and
make sure everyone of those son of a
bitches down there ends up on the
unemployment line. In fact, I'd sue
every man down there personally. I
would make it my life's ambition to
bring the LA County Jail to its knees.
I would do expose after expose on the
brutality, and the conditions, and the
inhumanity that exists here.

Mickey tosses the tape roll to Mallory and gestures to Duncan.
Mallory winks at Mickey. Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape
around the barrel of his shotgun.

MICKEY
That's what I thought. You tell them
that. When we go down those stairs, I
want you to scream what you just told
me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the
star of American Maniacs watched every
week by'-- how many people?

WAYNE
On average forty million.

MICKEY
'Every week by forty million people. I
am a respected journalist.' Have you
won any awards?

WAYNE
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The
Edward R. Murrow award...

MICKEY
'Respected journalist'-- On your
knees...

Wayne kneels in front of Mickey. While Mickey speaks he props
his shotgun under Wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the
barrel around his neck.

MICKEY
(continues)
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the
Edward R. Murrow award among others.'
Tell 'em the name of your personal
lawyer, his firm, his address, and
phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor
and the unemployment lines. You
getting the idea?

WAYNE
Yes.

Mickey stands with Wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the
stock of the shotgun.

MICKEY
Say it. Scream it. All the way out
the front door and into your van. And
if you stop screaming, I swear to God
I'll blow your head off.

WAYNE
Got it.

Mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before
shouting to Duncan.

MICKEY
You! What's your name?

Duncan can't answer, Mallory has gagged him with his tape. Mallory
grabs Duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before
reading his name badge.

MALLORY
Duncan...Homolka?

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON STAIRWELL (GROUND FLOOR) - DAY

Wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when
they hear:

MICKEY (O.S.)
Start.

Wayne and Duncan come into view with the Knoxs behind them.

The deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they
take out either Mickey of Mallory that Wayne or Duncan would
die.

Mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the
shotgun that's wrapped firmly to Duncan's neck. The pistol in
her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.

Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he
monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.

NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE
and COLOR 35mm.

Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA
on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be
spared.

WAYNE
(yelling)
My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star
of 'American Maniacs', watched by forty
million people every week! I am a
respected journalist, winners of the
Golden Globe, the Edward R.
Murrows Award among others! If anybody
puts me in danger, my network will sue
The Los Angeles County Sheriffs
Department. My estate will sue every
officer personally who fires. The
network's law firm is Rowlands, Davis
and Sinclair...

Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the
deputies.

MALLORY
(yelling)
Make a path!

The wall of deputies starts moving backward.

The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne
yelling all the way.

The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they
keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front
lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea.

Wurlitzer stands his ground.

WURLITZER
How far do you think your gonna get?

MICKEY
Right out the front door.

WURLITZER
That'll never happen.

MICKEY
It is happening.

The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their
speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep
their weapons ready.

Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

MALLORY
Don't stop!

Wayne starts up again.

The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer
are nose to nose.

WURLITZER
(to Mickey)
I will personally hunt you down, blow
the head off your fucking-whore-wife,
and plant your sick ass in the ground
all by myself.

MICKEY
(calmly)
Another day perhaps, but not today.

Mickey leaves FRAME.

CUT TO:

EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,
Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open
air.

A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while
Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.

FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.

Image DISSOLVES to BLACK & WHITE before BURNING into WHITE
LEADER.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &
WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being
filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a
fence post.

This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not
in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly
into the CAMERA.

WAYNE
This is Wayne Gayle. I'm wounded and
my crew, Roger and Scott, are dead.
This may be out of sync 'cause we are
shooting with a wild camera and a
standard recorder we found in the van.
Mickey Knox's plan worked. We walked
out the front door, into my news van
and made our getaway. When we were
followed by patrol cars, Mallory Knox
killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka
and tossed his body out of the back.
Mickey told authorities over my police
band that I would surely be next if
they didn't give up the pursuit. They
took Mickey at his word and called off
the pursuit. Why helicopters weren't
employed, I don't know. My only
thought is it all happened too fast for
arrangements to be made. We've just
pulled off to the side of the road to
do this interview. Tensions run high--

Mickey screams O.S.

MICKEY (O.S.)
We ain't got all fuckin' day!

WAYNE
Without any further ado, Mickey and
Mallory...

Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting
his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.

CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces
in and out of FRAME in the B.G.

WAYNE
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's
plan? Did you think it would work?

MALLORY
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground
floor that I totally realized they
weren't gonna shoot unless we shot
first. When we got out of the
stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my
God. This might work.' But
Mickey knew it would work all along.
There wasn't any doubt in his mind.
It's not like there was and he just
didn't show it. He knew it would work.

WAYNE (O.S.)
What did you think then?

MALLORY
I wondered how long it would be before
we'd get to be alone together. And I
wondered if I could wait that long.

WAYNE (O.S.)
Did you have anything to do with the
riot in the laundry room?

MALLORY
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin'
word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can
I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?

WAYNE (O.S.)
Try to keep it to a minimum.

MALLORY
We had nothing to do with that riot.
That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --

Mickey can be heard faintly in the B.G.

MICKEY
Divine intervention.

MALLORY
What he said. We didn't know jack shit
about and riot. It just happened. It
was kismet. We didn't even know those
people. How are we supposed to
organize a riot when we've been in
fuckin' isolation for the past year?
Just bleep out the fucks and jack
shits.
(laughs)
I mean, it's not like we care. If they
wanna say we masterminded the whole
thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep
us up at night. But you said you
wanted the truth, and the truth is we
were just lucky.

Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

MICKEY
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.

WAYNE (O.S.)
So, what now?

MALLORY
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take
it easy. Just enjoy each other's
company, stop and smell the roses,
notice the color purple, stuff like
that.

WAYNE (O.S.)
How do you intend to disappear? you're
probably the most famous couple in
America.

MALLORY
Well, back in slave times they had a
thing called the underground railroad.
And we got a whole fan club out there
just waiting to be conductors.
(to the camera)
So, you kids out there, keep the faith.
Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin'
to your town real soon.

MICKEY
Okay, that's enough. End of interview.
We gotta move.

Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne
lowers it from his eye.

WAYNE (O.S.)
Okay, just let me swing around and film
myself asking the questions. And then
I'll do my little wrap up.

Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he
balances it on a fence post.

MICKEY
Oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up,
all right. But it won't be you starin'
in the camera, looking dumb, and acting
stupid. Instead, you're gonna be
starin' down the barrels of our
shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the
triggers.

Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into
a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.

WAYNE
That's a joke right?

Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her
shotgun from off the ground.

WAYNE
Just wait one fucking minute.

MICKEY
I said I'd give you a interview. Now
unless I'm mistaken, we just did a
interview.
(to Mallory)
We did an interview, didn't we?

MALLORY
Looked like an interview to me.

MICKEY
I said we'd give you an interview. I
never said we wouldn't kill you.

WAYNE
Wait! I don't know, but I kinda felt
during this...this whole escape that
a kind of bond--

Wayne is shaking.

WAYNE
(continues)
...developed between the three of
us. We're kindda in this together,
don't ya think?

MICKEY
No. Not really.

WAYNE
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I
think I've already proven that a live
Wayne Gayle is much more better that a
dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your
passport out of jail, not Duncan
Homolka. But me! I'll be your
passport outta---

MICKEY
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate
you. If anybody in the fuckin' world
deserves to die, it's you.

Wayne is grasping for anything.

WAYNE
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and
Mallory always leave somebody alive to
tell the tale.

MICKEY
We are.
(points to camera)
Your camera.

Mickey turns to Mallory.

MICKEY
(John Wayne voice)
Let's make a little music, Colorada.

WAYNE
NO!!!

The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne,
who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing
into the news van, they drive away.

Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA
eventually runs out of film.

THE END
FADE IN:
INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 
going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 
to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 
through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing 
every time: never again, I'm through, 
too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. I'm 
always right too, but –

YOUNG WOMAN
– but you forget about it in a day 
or two -

YOUNG MAN
– yeah, well, the days of me 
forgittin' are over, and the days of 
me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know 
what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking man, 
is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck.
(imitates a duck)
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 
quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, 'cause you're never 
gonna hafta hear it again. Because 
since I'm never gonna do it again, 
you're never gonna hafta hear me 
quack about how I'm never gonna do 
it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in 
there, back and forth.

YOUNG MAN
(with a smile)
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes, thank you.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man 
lights up another cigarette.

YOUNG MAN
I'm doin' fine.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his 
smoke.

The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her 
coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you're 
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 
you rob a bank. You take more of a 
risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 
banks aren't supposed to stop you 
anyway, during a robbery. They're 
insured, why should they care? You 
don't even need a gun in a federal 
bank. I heard about this guy, walked 
into a federal bank with a portable 
phone, handed the phone to the teller, 
the guy on the other end of the phone 
said: "We got this guy's little girl, 
and if you don't give him all your 
money, we're gonna kill 'er."

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 
cleans the place out, and they don't 
lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don't know. There probably never 
was a little girl – the point of the 
story isn't the little girl. The 
point of the story is they robbed 
the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 
I'm just illustrating that if we 
did, it would be easier than what we 
been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down 
the same road, either dead or servin' 
twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about? 
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, 
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 
many foreigners own liquor stores. 
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: 
"Empty out the register," and they 
don't know what it fuckin' means. 
They make it too personal. We keep 
on, one of those gook motherfuckers' 
gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don't wanna kill anybody either. 
But they'll probably put us in a 
situation where it's us of them. And 
if it's not the gooks, it these old 
Jews who've owned the store for 
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got 
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the 
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try 
walkin' into one of those stores 
with nothin' but a telephone, see 
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget 
it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

He calls to the Waitress.

YOUNG MAN
Garcon! Coffee!

Then looks to his girl.

YOUNG MAN
This place.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

WAITRESS
(snotty)
"Garcon" means boy.

She splits.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with that? People never 
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 
stores, gas stations, you get your 
head blown off stickin' up one of 
them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 
you catch with their pants down. 
They're not expecting to get robbed, 
or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
(taking to idea)
I bet in places like this you could 
cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. Just like banks, these places 
are insured. The managers don't give 
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 
ya out the door before you start 
pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 
the register. Busboys, some wetback 
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 
gonna really give a fuck you're 
stealin' from the owner. Customers 
are sittin' there with food in their 
mouths, they don't know what's goin' 
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 
omelet, next minute somebody's 
stickin' a gun in their face.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man 
continues in a low voice.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor store 
we stuck up. 'Member all those 
customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
Then you got the idea to take 
everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then 
we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new 
information.

She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The 
tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the 
motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the 
COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's 
face.

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
(into it)
I'm ready, let's go, right here, 
right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you're 
crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on 
the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, 
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona 
is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is 
that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

PUMPKIN
(yelling to all)
Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
I'll execute every one of you 
motherfuckers!  Got that?

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

"PULP FICTION"

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS 
down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front 
seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both 
wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long 
green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES 
WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

JULES
– Okay now, tell me about the hash 
bars?

VINCENT
What so you want to know?

JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a 
hundred percent legal. I mean you 
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a 
joint, and start puffin' away. You're 
only supposed to smoke in your home 
or certain designated places.

JULES
Those are hash bars?

VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's 
legal to buy it, it's legal to own 
it and, if you're the proprietor of 
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 
really matter 'cause – get a load of 
this – if the cops stop you, it's 
illegal for this to search you. 
Searching you is a right that the 
cops in Amsterdam don't have.

JULES
That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin', 
that's all there is to it.

VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know 
what the funniest thing about Europe 
is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. A lotta 
the same shit we got here, they got 
there, but there they're a little 
different.

JULES
Examples?

VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer 
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean 
in a paper cup either. They give you 
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In 
Paris, you can buy beer at 
MacDonald's. Also, you know what 
they call a Quarter Pounder with 
Cheese in Paris?

JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder 
with Cheese?

VINCENT
No, they got the metric system there, 
they wouldn't know what the fuck a 
Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
What'd they call it?

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
(repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call 
a Big Mac?

VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call 
it Le Big Mac.

JULES
Le Big Mac. What do they call a 
Whopper?

VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger 
King.  But you know what they put on 
french fries in Holland instead of 
ketchup?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

JULES
Goddamn!

VINCENT
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a 
little bit on the side of the plate, 
they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES
Uuccch!

CUT TO:

INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING

The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach 
inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking 
them.

JULES
We should have shotguns for this 
kind of deal.

VINCENT
How many up there?

JULES
Three or four.

VINCENT
Counting our guy?

JULES
I'm not sure.

VINCENT
So there could be five guys up there?

JULES
It's possible.

VINCENT
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

They CLOSE the trunk.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically 
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what 
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

VINCENT
What's her name?

JULES
Mia.

VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES
I dunno, however people meet people. 
She usta be an actress.

VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES
I think her biggest deal was she 
starred in a pilot.

VINCENT
What's a pilot?

JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT
I don't watch TV.

JULES
Yes, but you're aware that there's 
an invention called television, and 
on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT
Yeah.

JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows on 
TV is they make one show, and that 
show's called a pilot. And they show 
that one show to the people who pick 
the shows, and on the strength of 
that one show, they decide if they 
want to make more shows. Some get 
accepted and become TV programs, and 
some don't, and become nothing. She 
starred in one of the ones that became 
nothing.

They enter the apartment building.

INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING

Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait 
for the elevator.

JULES
You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
black, half-Samoan, usta call him 
Tony Rocky Horror.

VINCENT
Yeah maybe, fat right?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call the 
brother fat. He's got a weight 
problem.  What's the nigger gonna 
do, he's Samoan.

VINCENT
I think I know who you mean, what 
about him?

JULES
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up 
good.  And word around the campfire, 
it was on account of Marsellus 
Wallace's wife.

The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING

VINCENT
What'd he do, fuck her?

JULES
No no no no no no no, nothin' that 
bad.

VINCENT
Well what then?

JULES
He gave her a foot massage.

VINCENT
A foot massage?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
That's all?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
What did Marsellus do?

JULES
Sent a couple of guys over to his 
place.  They took him out on the 
patio of his apartment, threw his 
ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell 
four stories. They had this garden 
at the bottom, enclosed in glass, 
like one of them greenhouses – nigger 
fell through that. Since then, he's 
kinda developed a speech impediment.

The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

VINCENT
That's a damn shame.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING

STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline 
down the hall.

VINCENT
Still I hafta say, play with matches, 
ya get burned.

JULES
Whaddya mean?

VINCENT
You don't be givin' Marsellus 
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

JULES
You don't think he overreacted?

VINCENT
Antwan probably didn't expect 
Marsellus to react like he did, but 
he had to expect a reaction.

JULES
It was a foot massage, a foot massage 
is nothing, I give my mother a foot 
massage.

VINCENT
It's laying hands on Marsellus 
Wallace's new wife in a familiar 
way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out 
– no, but you're in the same fuckin' 
ballpark.

Jules stops Vincent.

JULES
Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right 
there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' 
a bitch a foot massage ain't even 
the same fuckin' thing.

VINCENT
Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

JULES
It ain't no ballpark either. Look 
maybe your method of massage differs 
from mine, but touchin' his lady's 
feet, and stickin' your tongue in 
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the 
same ballpark, ain't the same league, 
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a foot massage?

JULES
Don't be tellin' me about foot 
massages – I'm the foot fuckin' 
master.

VINCENT
Given a lot of 'em?

JULES
Shit yeah. I got my technique down 
man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a guy a foot 
massage?

Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.

JULES
Fuck you.

He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a 
little bit behind.

VINCENT
How many?

JULES
Fuck you.

VINCENT
Would you give me a foot massage – 
I'm kinda tired.

JULES
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' 
pissed – this is the door.

The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They 
whisper.

JULES
What time is it?

VINCENT
(checking his watch)
Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

JULES
It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

They move a little away from the door, facing each other, 
still whispering.

JULES
Look, just because I wouldn't give 
no man a foot massage, don't make it 
right for Marsellus to throw Antwan 
off a building into a glass-
motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the 
way the nigger talks. That ain't 
right, man. Motherfucker do that to 
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 
I'd kill'a motherfucker.

VINCENT
I'm not sayin' he was right, but 
you're sayin' a foot massage don't 
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. 
I've given a million ladies a million 
foot massages and they all meant 
somethin'. We act like they don't, 
but they do. That's what's so fuckin' 
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's 
goin' on that nobody's talkin about, 
but you know it and she knows it, 
fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan 
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's 
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna 
have a sense of humor about that 
shit.

JULES
That's an interesting point, but 
let's get into character.

VINCENT
What's her name again?

JULES
Mia. Why you so interested in big 
man's wife?

VINCENT
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida 
and when he's gone, he wants me to 
take care of Mia.

JULES
Take care of her?

Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

VINCENT
Not that! Take her out. Show her a 
good time. Don't let her get lonely.

JULES
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace 
out on a date?

VINCENT
It ain't a date. It's like when you 
and your buddy's wife go to a movie 
or somethin'. It's just... you know... 
good company.

Jules just looks at him.

VINCENT
It's not a date.

Jules just looks at him.

INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a 
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to 
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

JULES
Hey kids.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the 
scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 
Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

JULES
How you boys doin'?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 
a question.

BRETT
We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

JULES
Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: "No."

JULES
We're associates of your business 
partner Marsellus Wallace, you 
remember your business partner 
dont'ya?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 
you're Brett, right?

BRETT
I'm Brett.

JULES
I thought so. Well, you remember 
your business partner Marsellus 
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT
I remember him.

JULES
Good for you. Looks like me and 
Vincent caught you at breakfast, 
sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

BRETT
Hamburgers.

JULES
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 
nutritious breakfast. What kinda 
hamburgers?

BRETT
Cheeseburgers.

JULES
No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

BRETT
Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 
had one myself, how are they?

BRETT
They're good.

JULES
Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Yours is this one, right?

BRETT
Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

JULES
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
(to Vincent)
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna 
Burger?

VINCENT
No.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

JULES
You wanna bite, they're real good.

VINCENT
I ain't hungry.

JULES
Well, if you like hamburgers give 
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 
a vegetarian. Which more or less 
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 
love the taste of a good burger.
(to Brett)
You know what they call a Quarter 
Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
Royale with Cheese, you know why 
they call it that?

BRETT
Because of the metric system?

JULES
Check out the big brain on Brett. 
You'a smart motherfucker, that's 
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fast 
food drink cup)
What's in this?

BRETT
Sprite.

JULES
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 
your tasty beverage to wash this 
down with?

BRETT
Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

JULES
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
(to Roger)
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: "Yes."

JULES
Then why don't you tell my boy here 
Vince, where you got the shit hid.

MARVIN
It's under the be –

JULES
– I don't remember askin' you a 
goddamn thing.
(to Roger)
You were sayin'?

ROGER
It's under the bed.

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out 
a black snap briefcase.

VINCENT
Got it.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see 
what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent 
just stares at it, transfixed.

JULES
We happy?

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

JULES
Vincent!

Vincent looks up at Jules.

JULES
We happy?

Closing the case.

VINCENT
We're happy.

BRETT
(to Jules)
Look, what's your name? I got his 
name's Vincent, but what's yours?

JULES
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' 
your ass outta this shit.

BRETT
I just want you to know how sorry we 
are about how fucked up things got 
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we 
entered into this thing, we only had 
the best intentions –

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger 
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, 
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

JULES
(to Brett)
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your 
concentration? I didn't mean to do 
that.  Please, continue. I believe 
you were saying something about "best 
intentions."

Brett can't say a word.

JULES
Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through 
anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would 
you describe for me what Marsellus 
Wallace looks like?

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing 
the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits 
in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in 
front of an interrogator.

JULES
What country you from!

BRETT
(petrified)
What?

JULES
"What" ain't no country I know! Do 
they speak English in "What?"

BRETT
(near heart attack)
What?

JULES
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace 
looks like!

BRETT
(out of fear)
What?

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's 
cheek.

JULES
Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" 
again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya 
motherfucker, say "What" one more 
goddamn time!

Brett is regressing on the spot.

JULES
Now describe to me what Marsellus 
Wallace looks like!

Brett does his best.

BRETT
Well he's... he's... black –

JULES
– go on!

BRETT
...and he's... he's... bald –

JULES
– does he look like a bitch?!

BRETT
(without thinking)
What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his 
eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in 
the chair.

JULES
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

BRETT
(in agony)
No.

JULES
Then why did you try to fuck 'im 
like a bitch?!

BRETT
(in spasm)
I didn't.

Now in a lower voice.

JULES
Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 
'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT
(in spasm)
Yes.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized, 
seems appropriate for this situation: 
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
righteous man is beset on all sides 
by the inequities of the selfish and 
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
he who, in the name of charity and 
good will, shepherds the weak through 
the valley of darkness, for he is 
truly his brother's keeper and the 
finder of lost children. And I will 
strike down upon thee with great 
vengeance and furious anger those 
who attempt to poison and destroy my 
brothers. And you will know my name 
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 
upon you."

The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting 
Brett.

AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

"VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"

FADE IN:

MEDIUM SHOT – BUTCH COOLIDGE

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old 
prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue 
high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is 
everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds 
like a cross between a gangster and a king.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I think you're gonna find – when all 
this shit is over and done – I think 
you're gonna find yourself one smilin' 
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right 
now you got ability. But painful as 
it may be, ability don't last. Now 
that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of 
life, but it's a fact of life your 
ass is gonna hafta git realistic 
about. This business is filled to 
the brim with unrealistic 
motherfuckers who thought their ass 
aged like wine.  Besides, even if 
you went all the way, what would you 
be? Feather-weight champion of the 
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you 
can even get a credit card based on 
that.

A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front 
of Butch. Butch picks it up.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Now the night of the fight, you may 
fell a slight sting, that's pride 
fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride 
only hurts, it never helps. Fight 
through that shit. 'Cause a year 
from now, when you're kickin' it in 
the Caribbean you're gonna say, 
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

BUTCH
I got no problem with that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

Butch nods his head: "yes."

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Say it!

BUTCH
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 
cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, 
ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus 
owns.

Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking 
lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, 
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. 
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 
Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally 
LeRoy's.

ENGLISH DAVE
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, 
git your ass on in here.

Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between 
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door 
in our faces.

INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave 
crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

VINCENT
Where's the big man?

ENGLISH DAVE
He's over there, finishing up some 
business.

VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with 
his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of 
yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Hang back for a second or two, and 
when you see the white boy leave, go 
on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 
make you an espresso?

VINCENT
How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' 
American?

ENGLISH DAVE
Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia 
out tomorrow?

VINCENT
At Marsellus' request.

ENGLISH DAVE
Have you met Mia?

VINCENT
Not yet.

English Dave smiles to himself.

VINCENT
What's so funny?

ENGLISH DAVE
Not a goddamn thing.

VINCENT
Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big 
man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 
across a table, chew my food with my 
mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and 
that's all I'm gonna do.

English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

ENGLISH DAVE
My name's Paul, and this is between 
y'all.

Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his 
cup of "Plain ol' American."

BUTCH
(to English Dave)
Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

ENGLISH DAVE
Filters?

BUTCH
Non.

While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his 
coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

BUTCH
Lookin' at somethin', friend?

VINCENT
I ain't your friend, palooka.

Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

BUTCH
What was that?

VINCENT
I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Vincent Vega has entered the building, 
git your ass over here!

Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another 
glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, 
looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching 
business.

BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure 
that is Marsellus.

Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend 
of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays 
English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT

CLOSEUP – JODY

A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of 
her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in 
her lips, eyebrows and nose.

JODY
...I'll lend it to you. It's a great 
book on body piercing.

Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen 
table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is 
at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

TRUDI
You know how they use that gun when 
they pierce your ears? They don't 
use that when they pierce your 
nipples, do they?

JODY
Forget that gun. That gun goes against 
the entire idea behind piercing. All 
of my piercing, sixteen places on my 
body, every one of 'em done with a 
needle. Five in each ear. One through 
the nipple on my left breast. One 
through my right nostril.  One through 
my left eyebrow. One through my lip. 
One in my clit. And I wear a stud in 
my tongue.

Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear 
and out the other, until that last remark.

VINCENT
(interrupting)
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm 
curious, why would you get a stud in 
your tongue?

Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious 
thing in the world.

JODY
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it 
makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent 
to ponder the truth of her statement.

LANCE (O.S.)
Vince, you can come in now!

INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly 
appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly 
personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult 
life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and 
has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a 
"Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

LANCE
Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very 
good stuff. This is Bava, different, 
but equally good. And this is Choco 
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. 
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce – those are friend 
prices – but this one...
(pointing to the Choco)
...this one's a little more expensive.  
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot 
it, you'll know where that extra 
money went.  Nothing wrong with the 
first two. It's real, real, real, 
good shit. But this one's a fuckin' 
madman.

VINCENT
Remember, I just got back from 
Amsterdam.

LANCE
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood? 
No.  You're in my house. White people 
who know the difference between good 
shit and bad shit, this is the house 
they come to. My shit, I'll take the 
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit 
any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

VINCENT
That's a bold statement.

LANCE
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is 
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin' 
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back 
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole 
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin, 
they're as hot as hell.

Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse 
to death.

VINCENT
Give me three hundred worth of the 
madman.  If it's as good as you say, 
I'll be back for a thousand.

LANCE
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya 
think of Trudi? She ain't got a 
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get 
high?

VINCENT
Which one's Trudi? The one with all 
the shit in her face?

LANCE
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

Vincent and Lance giggle at the "faux pas."

VINCENT
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a 
dinner engagement. Rain check?

LANCE
No problem?

Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting 
up).

VINCENT
You don't mind if I shoot up here?

LANCE
Me casa, su casa.

VINCENT
Mucho gracias.

Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two 
continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

LANCE
Still got your Malibu?

VINCENT
You know what some fucker did to it 
the other day?

LANCE
What?

VINCENT
Fuckin' keyed it.

LANCE
Oh man, that's fucked up.

VINCENT
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn 
thing in storage three years. It's 
out five fuckin' days – five days, 
and some dickless piece of shit fucks 
with it.

LANCE
They should be fuckin' killed. No 
trial, no jury, straight to execution.

As he cooks his heroin...

VINCENT
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, 
ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything 
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been 
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just 
caught 'em, you know what I mean?

LANCE
It's chicken shit. You don't fuck 
another man's vehicle.

CLOSEUP – THE NEEDLE

Going into Vincent's vein.

CLOSEUP – BLOOD

Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT'S THUMB

Pushing down on the plunger.

CUT TO:

EXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door

CLOSEUP – NOTE

The Note reads:

"Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside 
and make yourself a drink.  Mia"

MIA (V.O.)
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. 
The door's open. Come inside and 
make yourself a drink.

FADE TO WHITE

Music in.

FADE TO:

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent enters on the background.

VINCENT
Hello?

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in 
the background. Dusty Springfield is singing "SON OF A 
PREACHER MAN".

Mia's mouth comes toward a microphone.

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent turns.

MIA
(over intercom)
Vincent. I'm on the intercom.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
It's on the wall by the two African 
fellas.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
To your right.

Vincent walks.

MIA
...warm. Warmer. Disco.

Vincent finds the intercom on the wall.

VINCENT
Hello.

MIA
(over intercom)
Push the button if you want to talk.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Hello.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
Go make yourself a drink., and I'll 
be down in two shakes of a lamb's 
tail.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
The bar's by the fireplace.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Okay.
(licks lips)

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A video screen with an image of Vincent, walking. The Dusty 
Springfield song continues.

Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video 
camera in Marcellus' living room.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent picks up a bottle of scotch. He sniffs the bottle, 
and then pours it into a glass.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent drinks a glass of scotch.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

Mia sniffs the cocaine.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the 
wall.

Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record. 
The Dusty Springfield song stops.

MIA
Let's go.

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 
all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, 
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 
diners.

Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 
view.

Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with 
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a 
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath 
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that 
is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

VINCENT
What the fuck is this place?

MIA
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis 
man should love it.

VINCENT
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

MIA
You can get a steak here, daddy-o. 
Don't be a...

Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on 
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

VINCENT
After you, kitty-cat.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint 
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over 
the wall

("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF 
THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that 
the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s 
cars.

In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign 
on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers 
(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or 
barefeet.

The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, 
B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The 
WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: 
MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and 
LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing 
appropriate costumes.

Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 
'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting 
a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing 
you please me."

BUDDY
Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

VINCENT
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

BUDDY
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, 
or bloody as hell?

VINCENT
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a 
vanilla coke.

BUDDY
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

MIA
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger – 
bloody – and a five-dollar shake.

BUDDY
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and 
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

MIA
Martin and Lewis.

VINCENT
Did you just order a five-dollar 
shake?

MIA
Sure did.

VINCENT
A shake? Milk and ice cream?

MIA
Uh-huh.

VINCENT
It costs five dollars?

BUDDY
Yep.

VINCENT
You don't put bourbon in it or 
anything?

BUDDY
Nope.

VINCENT
Just checking.

Buddy exits.

Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are 
dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, 
and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, 
The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her 
customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a 
fool.

MIA
Whaddya think?

VINCENT
It's like a wax museum with a pulse 
rate.

Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling 
himself a smoke.

After a second of watching him –

MIA
What are you doing?

VINCENT
Rollin' a smoke.

MIA
Here?

VINCENT
It's just tobacco.

MIA
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll 
me one, cowboy?

As he finishes licking it –

VINCENT
You can have this one, cowgirl.

He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to 
her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's 
hand. He lights it.

MIA
Thanks.

VINCENT
Think nothing of it.

He begins rolling one for himself.

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, 
making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a 
square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS 
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out 
a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

Back to Mia and Vincent.

MIA
Marsellus said you just got back 
from Amsterdam.

VINCENT
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

MIA
That was my fifteen minutes.

VINCENT
What was it?

MIA
It was show about a team of female 
secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

VINCENT
What?

MIA
"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a 
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in 
we're a force to be reckoned with. 
Five, as in there's one... two ... 
three... four... five of us. There 
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal 
from that show "Baton Rouge," she 
was the leader. A Japanese one, a 
black one, a French one and a brunette 
one, me.  We all had special skills. 
Sommerset had a photographic memory, 
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, 
the black girl was a demolition 
expert, the French fox' specialty 
was sex...

VINCENT
What was your specialty?

MIA
Knives. The character I played, Raven 
McCoy, her background was she was 
raised by circus performers. So she 
grew up doing a knife act. According 
to the show, she was the deadliest 
woman in the world with a knife. But 
because she grew up in a circus, she 
was also something of an acrobat. 
She could do illusions, she was a 
trapeze artist – when you're keeping 
the world safe from evil, you never 
know when being a trapeze artist's 
gonna come in handy. And she knew a 
zillion old jokes her grandfather, 
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If 
we woulda got picked up, they woulda 
worked in a gimmick where every 
episode I woulda told and ol joke.

VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes?

MIA
Well I only got the chance to say 
one, 'cause we only did one show.

VINCENT
Tell me.

MIA
No. It's really corny.

VINCENT
C'mon, don't be that way.

MIA
No. You won't like it and I'll be 
embarrassed.

VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million 
people and you can't tell it to me? 
I promise I won't laugh.

MIA
(laughing)
That's what I'm afraid of.

VINCENT
That's not what I meant and you know 
it.

MIA
You're quite the silver tongue devil, 
aren't you?

VINCENT
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

MIA
That's not what you said Vince. Well 
now I'm definitely not gonna tell 
ya, 'cause it's been built up too 
much.

VINCENT
What a gyp.

Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around 
the straw of her shake.

MIA
Yummy!

VINCENT
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like 
to know what a five-dollar shake 
tastes like.

MIA
Be my guest.

She slides the shake over to him.

MIA
You can use my straw, I don't have 
kooties.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
Yeah, but maybe I do.

MIA
Kooties I can handle.

He takes a sip.

VINCENT
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' 
good milk shake.

MIA
Told ya.

VINCENT
I don't know if it's worth five 
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' 
good.

He slides the shake back.

Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

MIA
Don't you hate that?

VINCENT
What?

MIA
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we 
feel it's necessary to yak about 
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

VINCENT
I don't know.

MIA
That's when you know you found 
somebody special. When you can just 
shit the fuck up for a minute, and 
comfortably share silence.

VINCENT
I don't think we're there yet. But 
don't feel bad, we just met each 
other.

MIA
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to 
the bathroom and powder my nose, 
while you sit here and think of 
something to say.

VINCENT
I'll do that.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT

Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the 
bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

MIA
(imitating Steppenwolf)
I said goddamn!

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT

Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his 
eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

Mia comes back to the table.

MIA
Don't you love it when you go to the 
bathroom and you come back to find 
your food waiting for you?

VINCENT
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy 
Holly doesn't seem to be much of a 
waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn 
Monroe's section.

MIA
Which one, there's two Marilyn 
Monroes.

VINCENT
No there's not.

Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

VINCENT
That's Marilyn Monroe...

Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and 
capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –

VINCENT
... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I 
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it 
must be her night off.

MIA
Pretty smart.

VINCENT
I have moments.

MIA
Did ya think of something to say?

VINCENT
Actually, there's something I've 
wanted to ask you about, but you 
seem like a nice person, and I didn't 
want to offend you.

MIA
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 
mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
you chit-chat. This sounds like you 
actually have something to say.

VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get 
offended.

MIA
You can't promise something like 
that. I have no idea what you're 
gonna ask. You could ask me what 
you're gonna ask me, and my natural 
response could be to be offended. 
Then, through no fault of my own, I 
woulda broken my promise.

VINCENT
Then let's just forget it.

MIA
That is an impossibility. Trying to 
forget anything as intriguing as 
this would be an exercise in futility.

VINCENT
Is that a fact?

Mia nods her head: "Yes."

MIA
Besides, it's more exciting when you 
don't have permission.

VINCENT
What do you think about what happened 
to Antwan?

MIA
Who's Antwan?

VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror.

MIA
He fell out of a window.

VINCENT
That's one way to say it. Another 
way is, he was thrown out. Another 
was is, he was thrown out by 
Marsellus. And even another way is, 
he was thrown out of a window by 
Marsellus because of you.

MIA
Is that a fact?

VINCENT
No it's not, it's just what I heard.

MIA
Who told you this?

VINCENT
They.

Mia and Vincent smile.

MIA
They talk a lot, don't they?

VINCENT
They certainly do.

MIA
Well don't by shy Vincent, what 
exactly did they say?

Vincent is slow to answer.

MIA
Let me help you Bashful, did it 
involve the F-word?

VINCENT
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave 
you a foot massage.

MIA
And...?

VINCENT
No and, that's it.

MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror 
out of a four-story window because 
he massaged my feet?

VINCENT
Yeah.

MIA
And you believed that?

VINCENT
At the time I was told, it seemed 
reasonable.

MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a 
four story window for giving me a 
foot massage seemed reasonable?

VINCENT
No, it seemed excessive. But that 
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I 
heard Marsellus is very protective 
of you.

MIA
A husband being protective of his 
wife is one thing. A husband almost 
killing another man for touching his 
wife's feet is something else.

VINCENT
But did it happen?

MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched 
of mine was my hand, when he shook 
it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding 
– then never again.  The truth is, 
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed 
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window 
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky 
Horror. But when you scamps get 
together, you're worse than a sewing 
circle.

CUT TO:

ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment 
you've all been waiting for, the 
worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist 
contest.

Patrons cheer.

Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...One lucky couple will win this 
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is 
holding.

Marilyn holds the trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...Now, who will be our first 
contestants?

Mia holds her hand.

MIA
Right here.

Vincent reacts.

MIA
I wanna dance.

VINCENT
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

MIA
(overlapping)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do 
believe Marsellus, my husband, your 
boss, told you to take me out and do 
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to 
dance. I want to win. I want that 
trophy.

VINCENT
(sighs)
All right.

MIA
So, dance good.

VINCENT
All right, you asked for it.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Let's hear it for our first 
contestants.

Patrons cheer.

Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

ED SULLIVAN
Now let's meet our first contestants 
here this evening. Young lady, what 
is your name?

MIA
(into microphone)
Missus Mia Wallace.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent Vega.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
All right, let's see what you can 
do. Take it away!

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". 
They make hand movements as they dance.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the 
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

Then...

The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

VINCENT
Was than an uncomfortable silence?

MIA
I don't know what that was.
(pause)
Music and drinks!

Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his 
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

VINCENT
I'm gonna take a piss.

MIA
That was a little bit more information 
than I needed to know, but go right 
ahead.

Vincent shuffles off to the john.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs 
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 
feels good.

Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. 
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her 
face.

MIA
(like you would say 
Bingo!)
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, 
you've been holding out on me.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to 
himself in the mirror.

VINCENT
One drink and leave. Don't be rude, 
but drink your drink quickly, say 
goodbye, walk out the door, get in 
your car, and go down the road.

LIVING ROOM

Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines 
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred 
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the 
fat line.

CLOSEUP – MIA

Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels 
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. 
Then... the rush hits...

BATHROOM

Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his 
dialogue with the mirror.

VINCENT
...It's a moral test of yourself, 
whether or not you can maintain 
loyalty. Because when people are 
loyal to each other, that's very 
meaningful.

LIVING ROOM

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but 
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from 
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her 
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

BATHROOM

Vince continues.

VINCENT
So you're gonna go out there, drink 
your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 
a very lovely evening," go home, and 
jack off.  And that's all you're 
gonna do.

Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's 
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of 
that door. So he goes through it.

LIVING ROOM

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to 
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like 
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are 
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the 
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her 
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. 
Slack-jawed.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. 
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck 
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

VINCENT
(sounding weird)
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, 
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

VINCENT
(to himself)
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
(to Mia)
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer 
me honey, what did you take?

Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the 
rack.

He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent 
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

VINCENT
(yelling to Mia)
Okay honey, we're getting you on 
your feet.

He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

VINCENT
We're on our feet now, and now we're 
gonna talk out to the car. Here we 
go, watch us walk.

We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, 
speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting 
like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when 
he glances over at Mia.

Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag 
of water.

Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches 
a number.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant 
drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, 
CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand 
is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of 
him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n 
Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in 
an ashtray.

On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three 
Stooges, and they're getting married.

PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
(on TV)
Hold hands, you love birds.

The phone RINGS.

Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

It RINGS again.

Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

JODY (O.S.)
Lance! The phone's ringing!

LANCE
(calling back)
I can hear it!

JODY (O.S.)
I thought you told those fuckin' 
assholes never to call this late!

LANCE
(by the phone)
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna 
tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
(he answers the phone)
Hello, do you know how late it is? 
You're not supposed to be callin' me 
this fuckin' late.

BACK TO:

VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching 
the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the 
conversation.

VINCENT
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big 
fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way 
to your place.

LANCE
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's 
the problem?

VINCENT
You still got an adrenaline shot?

LANCE
(dawning on him)
Maybe.

VINCENT
I need it man, I got a chick she's 
fuckin'  Doing on me.

LANCE
Don't bring her here!  I'm not even 
fuckin' joking with you, don't you 
be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt 
to my house!

VINCENT
No choice.

LANCE
She's ODin'?

VINCENT
Yeah. She's dyin'.

LANCE
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 
'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

VINCENT
Negative.

LANCE
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you 
fucked her up, you deal with it – 
are you talkin' to me on a cellular 
phone?

VINCENT
Sorry.

LANCE
I don't know you, who is this, don't 
come here, I'm hangin' up.

VINCENT
Too late, I'm already here.

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu 
coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his 
curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH 
in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn 
and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out 
of SHATTERS from the impact.

JODY (O.S.)
What the hell was that?

Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front 
lawn.

EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia 
out.

LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed 
your car in my fuckin' house! You 
talk about drug shit on a cellular 
fuckin' phone –

VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little 
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get 
your needle and git it now!

LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin' 
that fucked up bitch in my house!

VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus 
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' 
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But 
before he turns me into a bar soap, 
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about 
how you coulda saved her life, but 
instead you let her die on your front 
lawn.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's 
wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone 
on it.

We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking 
through the hall into the living room.

JODY
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn 
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on 
out here?

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance 
standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of 
the room.

From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a 
DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference 
here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

JODY
Who's she?

Lance looks up at Jody.

LANCE
Get that black box in the bedroom I 
have with the adrenaline shot.

JODY
What's wrong with her?

VINCENT
She's ODing on us.

JODY
Well get her the hell outta here!

LANCE AND VINCENT
(in stereo)
Get the fuckin' shot!

JODY
Don't yell and me!

She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking 
for the shot.

WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

VINCENT
(to Lance)
You two are a match made in heaven.

LANCE
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta 
get a medical book.

VINCENT
What do you need a medical book for?

LANCE
To tell me how to do it. I've never 
given an adrenaline shot before.

VINCENT
You've had that thing for six years 
and you never used it?

LANCE
I never had to use it. I don't go 
joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all 
of my friends can handle their highs!

VINCENT
Well then get it.

LANCE
I am, if you'll let me.

VINCENT
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

LANCE
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' 
to her.

WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning 
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, 
"Come on," endlessly.

From OFF SCREEN we hear:

VINCENT (O.S.)
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

LANCE
(calling back)
I'm looking as fast as I can!

Lance continues his frenzied search.

WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

JODY (O.S.)
What's he lookin' for?

VINCENT (O.S.)
I dunno, some medical book.

Jody calls to LANCE.

JODY (O.S.)
What are you lookin' for?

LANCE
My black medical book!

As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, 
Jody appears in the doorway.

JODY
Whata're you looking for?

LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's 
like a text book they give to nurses.

JODY
I never saw a medical book.

LANCE
Trust me, I have one.

JODY
Well if it's that important, why 
didn't you keep it with the shot?

Lance spins toward her.

LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

JODY
While you're lookin' for it, that 
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're 
never gonna find it in all this shit.  
For six months now, I've been telling 
you to clean this room –

VINCENT (O.S.)
– get your ass in here, fuck the 
book!

Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT 
heading for the living room.

LIVING ROOM

Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance 
reenters the room.

VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her 
the shot!

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He 
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

LANCE
While I'm doing this, take her shirt 
off and find her heart.

Vince rips her blouse open.

Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?

LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving 
her an injection in the heart, so I 
gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her 
heart is, I think it's here.

Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and 
nods.

LANCE
That's it.

As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got 
one?

JODY
What?

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any 
felt pen'll do, but a magic marker 
would be great.

JODY
Hold on.

Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her 
enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents 
of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

LANCE
It's ready, I'll tell you what to 
do.

VINCENT
You're gonna give her the shot.

LANCE
No, you're gonna give her the shot.

VINCENT
I've never does this before.

LANCE
I've never done this before either, 
and I ain't starting now. You brought 
'er here, that means you give her 
the shot. The day I bring an ODing 
bitch to your place, then I gotta 
give her the shot.

Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 
marker in her hand.

JODY
Got it.

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?

LANCE
Well, you're giving her an injection 
of adrenaline straight to her heart. 
But she's got a breast plate in front 
of her heart, so you gotta pierce 
through that. So what you gotta do 
is bring the needle down in a stabbing 
motion.

Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The 
Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

VINCENT
I gotta stab her?

LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce 
through to her heart, you gotta stab 
her hard.

Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

VINCENT
What happens after that?

LANCE
I'm curious about that myself.

VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it 
like –
(snaps his fingers)
– that.

Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing 
motion.

He looks down on Mia.

Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

VINCENT
Count to three.

Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know 
what to expect.

LANCE
One...

RED DOT on Mia's body.

Needle raised ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...two...

Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...three!

The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 
chest.

Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 
out through the needle.

Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 
the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck 
in her chest – SCREAMING.

Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in 
front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 
air.

The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 
to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

LANCE
If you're okay, say something.

Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a 
relatively normal voice.

MIA
Something.

Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and 
shaking from how close to death Mia came.

JODY
Anybody want a beer?

CUT TO:

INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says 
anything, both are still too shaken.

EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying 
a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway 
toward her front door.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!

She turns around.

Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big 
distance between the two.

VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to 
handle this?

MIA
What's yours?

VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus 
can live his whole live and never 
ever hear of this incident.

Mia smiles.

MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus 
ever heard of this, I'd be in as 
much trouble as you.

VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.

MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.

VINCENT
Let's shake on it.

The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to 
shake and shake they do.

VINCENT
Mum's the word.

Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home 
and have a heart attack.

Mia giggles.

Vincent turns to leave.

MIA
You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE 
FIVE" joke?

Vincent turns around.

VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little 
too petrified to laugh.

MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's 
not funny. But if you still wanna 
hear it, I'll tell it.

VINCENT
I can't wait.

MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the 
street, a poppa tomato, a momma 
tomato, and a little baby tomato. 
The baby tomato is lagging behind 
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa 
tomato gets mad, goes over to the 
momma tomato and stamps on him –
(stamps on the ground)
– and says: catch up.

They both smile, but neither laugh.

MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.

Mia turns and walks inside her house.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT

After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where 
she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a 
kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu 
START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP On the cartoon "SPEED RACER."  Speed is giving a 
detailed description of all the features on his race car 
"The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode.

OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.

DISSOLVE TO:

BUTCH'S POV

We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in 
Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, 
stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to 
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force 
officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old 
boy.

MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We 
got a special visitor. Now do you 
remember when I told you your daddy 
dies in a P.O.W. camp?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.

MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He 
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and 
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's 
eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas 
accent.

CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard 
a bunch about you. See, I was a good 
friend of your Daddy's. We were in 
that Hanoi pit of hell over five 
years together.  Hopefully, you'll 
never have to experience this 
yourself, but when two men are in a 
situation like me and your Daddy 
were, for as long as we were, you 
take on certain responsibilities of 
the other. If it had been me who had 
not made it, Major Coolidge would be 
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But 
the way it worked out is I'm talkin' 
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for 
ya.

The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first 
purchased by your great-granddaddy. 
It was bought during the First World 
War in a little general store in 
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 
the day he set sail for Paris. It 
was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 
made by the first company to ever 
make wrist watches. You see, up until 
then, people just carried pocket 
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 
that watch every day he was in the 
war. Then when he had done his duty, 
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his 
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 
can. And in that can it stayed 'til 
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 
called upon by his country to go 
overseas and fight the Germans once 
again. This time they called it World 
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 
it to your granddad for good luck.  
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 
good as his old man's. Your granddad 
was a Marine and he was killed with 
all the other Marines at the battle 
of Wake Island. Your granddad was 
facing death and he knew it. None of 
those boys had any illusions about 
ever leavin' that island alive. So 
three days before the Japanese took 
the island, your 22-year old 
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 
Force transport named Winocki, a man 
he had never met before in his life, 
to deliver to his infant son, who he 
had never seen in the flesh, his 
gold watch. Three days later, your 
grandfather was dead. But Winocki 
kept his word. After the war was 
over, he paid a visit to your 
grandmother, delivering to your infant 
father, his Dad's gold watch. This 
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 
wrist when he was shot down over 
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 
be confiscated. The way your Daddy 
looked at it, that watch was your 
birthright. And he'd be damned if 
and slopeheads were gonna put their 
greasy yella hands on his boy's 
birthright. So he hid it in the one 
place he knew he could hide somethin'. 
His ass. Five long years, he wore 
this watch up his ass. Then when he 
died of dysentery, he gave me the 
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 
of metal up my ass for two years. 
Then, after seven years, I was sent 
home to my family. And now, little 
man, I give the watch to you.

Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes 
into FRAME to accept it.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: 
trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few 
zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to 
him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, 
he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a 
little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to 
be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

KLONDIKE
It's time, Butch.

BUTCH
I'm ready.

Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB 
outside.

He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch 
hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him 
on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH 
COOLIDGE".

The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for 
Butch.

As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. 
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, 
empty locker room.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"THE GOLD WATCH"

We hear over the black and white title:

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
– Well Dan, that had to be the 
bloodiest and, hands-down, the most 
brutal fight this city has ever seen.

The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT

A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The 
sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked 
car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from 
inside.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
...Coolidge was out of there faster 
than I've ever seen a victorious 
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think 
he knew Willis was dead?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I 
could see from my position here, the 
frenzy in his eyes give way to the 
realization of what he was doing. I 
think any man would've left the ring 
that fast.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named 
ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks, 
sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a 
white styrofoam cup.

The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
Do you feel this ring death tragedy 
will have an effect on the world of 
boxing?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't 
help but shake the world of boxing 
to its very foundation. But it's of 
paramount importance that during the 
sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the 
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –

CLICK – Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in 
the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage 
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed 
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to 
the dumpster below.

ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS 
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and 
throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, 
HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through 
the rearview mirror:

ESMARELDA
(Spanish accent)
Are you the man I was supposed to 
pick up?

BUTCH
If you're the cab I called, I'm the 
guy you're supposed to pick up.

ESMARELDA
Where to?

BUTCH
Outta here.

The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

The meter is FLIPPED on.

Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet 
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT

Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through 
the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, 
shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave 
takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by 
the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

VINCENT
Mia. How you doin'?

MIA
Great. I never thanked you for the 
dinner.

In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table – 
dead.

His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is 
on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, 
hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. 
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
What'cha got?

ENGLISH DAVE
He booked.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I'm prepared to scour the earth for 
this motherfucker. If Butch goes to 
Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' 
in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a 
cap in his ass.

ENGLISH DAVE
I'll take care of it.

INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't 
find the roll bar.

BUTCH
Hey, how do I open the window back 
here?

ESMARELDA
I have to do it.

She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch 
tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying 
the other one.

Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

ESMARELDA
Hey, mister?

BUTCH
(still working on the 
glove)
What?

ESMARELDA
You were in that fight? The fight on 
the radio – you're the fighter?

As he tosses his other glove out the window.

BUTCH
Whatever gave you that idea?

ESMARELDA
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're 
him, tell me you're him.

BUTCH
(drying himself with 
a gym towel)
I'm him.

ESMARELDA
You killed the other boxing man.

BUTCH
He's dead?

ESMARELDA
The radio said he was dead.

He finished wiping himself down.

BUTCH
(to himself)
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

He tosses the towel out the window.

Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

ESMARELDA
What does it feel like?

BUTCH
(finds his shirt)
What does what feel like?

ESMARELDA
Killing a man. Beating another man 
to death with your bare hands.

Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

BUTCH
Are you some kinda weirdo?

ESMARELDA
No, it's a subject I have much 
interest in. You are the first person 
I ever met who has killed somebody. 
So, what was it like to kill a man?

BUTCH
Tell ya what, you give me one of 
them cigarettes, I'll give you an 
answer.

Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

ESMARELDA
Deal!

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, 
passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not 
looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in 
it.

Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

He takes a long drag.

BUTCH
So...

He looks at her license.

BUTCH
...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that 
Mexican?

ESMARELDA
The name is Spanish, but I'm 
Columbian.

BUTCH
It's a very pretty name.

ESMARELDA
It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

BUTCH
That's one hell of a name you got 
there, sister.

ESMARELDA
Thank you. And what is your name?

BUTCH
Butch.

ESMARELDA
Butch. What does it mean?

BUTCH
I'm an American, our names don't 
mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, 
what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

ESMARELDA
I want to know what it feels like to 
kill a man –

BUTCH
– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know 
he was dead 'til you told me he was 
dead. Now I know he's dead, do you 
wanna know how I feel about it?

Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

BUTCH
I don't feel the least little bit 
bad.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

BUTCH
(into phone)
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word 
got out a fix was in, the odds would 
be outta control. Hey, if he was a 
better fighter he's be alive. If he 
never laced up his gloves in the 
first place, which he never shoulda 
done, he'd be alive. Enough about 
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's 
talk about the rich and prosperous 
Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you 
spread it around with?

(PAUSE)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have 
it all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news – I 
understand a few stragglers aside. 
Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in 
the morning. It should take us a 
couple days to get into Knoxville. 
Next time we see each other, it'll 
be on Tennessee time.

Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to 
take him wherever he wants to go.

BUTCH
(to himself in French 
with English subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure 
begins.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain 
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, 
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic 
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.

Handing her the money.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little 
something for the effort.

Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds 
it out of reach.

BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about 
who your fare was tonight, what're 
you gonna tell 'em?

ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed, 
slightly toasted, Mexicans.

He gives her the bill.

BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.

ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.

He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. 
She drives off.

INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT

Butch enters and turns on the light.

Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to 
us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

FABIENNE
Keep the light off.

Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

BUTCH
Is that better, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Oui. Hard day at the office?

BUTCH
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

FABIENNE
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in 
babytalk.

FABIENNE
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

BUTCH
Uh-huh?

FABIENNE
I wish I had a pot.

BUTCH
You were lookin' in the mirror and 
you wish you had some pot?

FABIENNE
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are 
sexy.

BUTCH
Well you should be happy, 'cause you 
do.

FABIENNE
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! 
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna 
when she did "Lucky Star," it's not 
the same thing.

BUTCH
I didn't realize there was a 
difference between a tummy and a pot 
belly.

FABIENNE
The difference is huge.

BUTCH
You want me to have a pot?

FABIENNE
No. Pot bellies make a man look either 
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 
rest of you is normal. Normal face, 
normal legs, normal hips, normal 
ass, but with a big, perfectly round 
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 
tee-shirt two sizes too small to 
accentuate it.

BUTCH
You think guys would find that 
attractive?

FABIENNE
I don't give a damn what men find 
attractive. It's unfortunate what we 
find pleasing to the touch and 
pleasing to the eye is seldom the 
same.

BUTCH
If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in 
it.

FABIENNE
You'd punch me in my belly?

BUTCH
Right in the belly.

FABIENNE
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your 
right on your face 'til you couldn't 
breathe.

BUTCH
You'd do that to me?

FABIENNE
Yes!

BUTCH
Did you get everything, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Yes, I did.

BUTCH
Good job.

FABIENNE
Did everything go as planned?

BUTCH
You didn't listen to the radio?

FABIENNE
I never listen to your fights. Were 
you the winner?

BUTCH
I won alright.

FABIENNE
Are you still retiring?

BUTCH
Sure am.

FABIENNE
What about the man you fought?

BUTCH
Floyd retired too.

FABIENNE
(smiling)
Really?! He won't be fighting no 
more?!

BUTCH
Not no more.

FABIENNE
So it all worked out in the finish?

BUTCH
We ain't at the finish, baby.

Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

FABIENNE
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
If they find us, they'll kill us, 
won't they?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But they won't find us, will they?

Butch nods his head: "no."

FABIENNE
Do you still want me to go with you?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
I don't want to be a burden or a 
nuisance -

Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her 
crotch.

Fabienne reacts.

FABIENNE
Say it!

BUTCH
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

FABIENNE
Forever?

BUTCH
...and ever.

Fabienne lies her head back.

Butch continues to massage her crotch.

FABIENNE
Do you love me?

BUTCH
Oui.

FABIENNE
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

Butch kisses her on the mouth.

BUTCH
Will you kiss it?

She nods her head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But you first.

Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral 
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

FABIENNE
(in French, with 
English subtitles)
Butch my love, the adventure begins.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in 
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We 
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow 
her up.

She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower 
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the 
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. 
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his 
head out.

BUTCH
I think I cracked a rib.

FABIENNE
Giving me oral pleasure?

BUTCH
No retard, from the fight.

FABIENNE
Don't call me retard.

BUTCH
(in a Mongoloid voice)
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

FABIENNE
Shut up fuck head! I hate that 
Mongoloid voice.

BUTCH
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it 
back!  Can I have a towel please, 
Miss Beautiful Tulip.

FABIENNE
Oh I like that, I like being called 
a tulip. Tulip is much better than 
Mongoloid.

She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban 
on her head.

BUTCH
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I 
called you a retard, but I took it 
back.

She hands him a towel.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup.

FABIENNE
Butch?

BUTCH
(drying his head)
Yes, lemon pie.

FABIENNE
Where are we going to go?

BUTCH
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. 
We're gonna get a lot of money from 
this. But it ain't gonna be so much, 
we can live like hogs in the fat 
house forever. I was thinking we 
could go somewhere in the South 
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll 
carry us a long way down there.

FABIENNE
So if we wanted, we could live in 
Bora Bora?

BUTCH
You betcha. And if after awhile you 
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can 
move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

FABIENNE
But I do not speak Spanish.

BUTCH
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta 
el zapataria?

FABIENNE
What does that mean?

BUTCH
Where's the shoe store?

FABIENNE
Donde esta el zapataria?

BUTCH
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be 
my little mama ceta in no time.

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes 
her teeth.

Butch keeps on from the other room.

BUTCH (O.S.)
Que hora es?

FABIENNE
Que hora es?

BUTCH (O.S.)
What time is it?

FABIENNE
What time is it?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or 
two, then she remember something.

FABIENNE
Butch.

She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only 
to find him sound asleep in bed.

She looks at him for a moment.

FABIENNE
Forget it.

She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the 
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM – MORNING

SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still 
asleep in bed.

Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the 
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still 
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking 
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing 
him.

His start startles Fabienne.

FABIENNE
Merde! You startled me. Did you have 
a bad dream?

Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to 
focus.

Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV 
Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

BUTCH
What are you watching?

FABIENNE
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the 
name.

BUTCH
Are you watchin' it?

Fabienne enters the room.

FABIENNE
In a way. Why? Would you like for me 
to switch it off?

BUTCH
Would you please?

She reaches over and turns off the TV.

BUTCH
It's a little too early in the morning 
for explosions and war.

FABIENNE
What was it about?

BUTCH
How should I know, you were the one 
watchin' it.

Fabienne laughs.

FABIENNE
No, imbecile, what was your dream 
about?

BUTCH
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really 
rare I remember a dream.

FABIENNE
You just woke up from it.

BUTCH
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I 
don't remember.

FABIENNE
Well, let's look at the grumpy man 
in the morning. I didn't say you 
were lying, it's just odd you don't 
remember your dreams. I always 
remember mine. Did you know you talk 
in your sleep?

BUTCH
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk 
in my sleep?

FABIENNE
You did last night.

BUTCH
What did I say?

Laying on top of him.

FABIENNE
I don't know. I couldn't understand 
you.

She kisses Butch.

FABIENNE
Why don't you get up and we'll get 
some breakfast at that breakfast 
place with the pancakes.

BUTCH
One more kiss and I'll get up.

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

FABIENNE
Satisfied?

BUTCH
Yep.

FABIENNE
Then get up, lazy bones.

Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of 
the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

BUTCH
What time is it?

FABIENNE
Almost nine in the morning. What 
time does our train arrive?

BUTCH
Eleven.

FABIENNE
I'm gonna order a big plate of 
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 
eggs over easy, and five sausages.

BUTCH
(surprised at her 
potential appetite)
Anything to drink with that?

Butch is finished dressing.

FABIENNE
(referring to his 
clothes)
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a 
tall glass or orange juice and a 
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm 
going to have a slice of pie.

As he goes through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Pie for breakfast?

FABIENNE
Any time of the day is a good time 
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with 
the pancakes. And on top, a thin 
slice of melted cheese –

BUTCH
– where's my watch?

FABIENNE
It's there.

BUTCH
No, it's not. It's not here.

FABIENNE
Have you looked?

By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

He's now throwing clothes.

BUTCH
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! 
Are you sure you got it?

Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

FABIENNE
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer 
–

BUTCH
– on the little kangaroo.

FABIENNE
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

BUTCH
Well it's not here!

FABIENNE
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!

BUTCH
Oh it most definitely should be here, 
but it's not. So where is it?

Fabienne is crying and scared.

Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more 
menacing.

BUTCH
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' 
watch. You know what my father went 
through to git me that watch?... I 
don't wanna get into it right now... 
but he went through a lot. Now all 
this other shit, you coulda set on 
fire, but I specifically reminded 
you not to forget my father's watch. 
Now think, did you get it?

FABIENNE
I believe so...

BUTCH
You believe so? You either did, or 
you didn't, now which one is it?

FABIENNE
Then I did.

BUTCH
Are you sure?

FABIENNE
(shaking)
No.

Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the 
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

BUTCH
(to Fabienne)
No! It's not your fault.
(he approached her)
You left it at the apartment.

He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

He touches her hand, she flinches.

BUTCH
If you did leave it at the apartment, 
it's not your fault. I had you bring 
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 
about it, but I didn't illustrate 
how personal the watch was to me. If 
all I gave a fuck about was my watch, 
I should've told you. You ain't a 
mind reader.

He kisses her hand. Then rises.

Fabienne is still sniffling.

Butch goes to the closet.

FABIENNE
I'm sorry.

Butch puts on his high school jacket.

BUTCH
Don't be. It just means I won't be 
able to eat breakfast with you.

FABIENNE
Why does it mean that?

BUTCH
Because I'm going back to my apartment 
to get my watch.

FABIENNE
Won't the gangsters be looking for 
you there?

BUTCH
That's what I'm gonna find out. If 
they are, and I don't think I can 
handle it, I'll split.

Rising from the floor.

FABIENNE
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, 
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

BUTCH
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing 
you could ever do would make me 
permanently angry at you.
(pause)
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money 
out of his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those 
pancakes and have a great breakfast.

FABIENNE
Don't go.

BUTCH
I'll be back before you can say, 
blueberry pie.

FABIENNE
Blueberry pie.

BUTCH
Well maybe not that fast, but fast. 
Okay?  Okay?

FABIENNE
Okay.

He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

BUTCH
Bye-bye, sugar pop.

FABIENNE
Bye.

BUTCH
I'm gonna take your Honda.

FABIENNE
Okay.

And with that, he's out the door.

Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY

Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his 
fists as he drives down the street.

BUTCH
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda 
forgot, she forgets my father's watch. 
I specifically reminded her not to 
forget it. "Bedside table – on the 
kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't 
forget my father's watch."

EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is 
little engine will take it.

CUT TO:

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the 
arrow pointing at one hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY

Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a 
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before 
he goes boppin' through the front door.

EXT. ALLEY – DAY

Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, 
then he discreetly glances out.

EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of 
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of 
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of 
Butch's home.

Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign 
sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a 
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment 
building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry 
room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears 
disturbed.

Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening 
it.

INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

His apartment hasn't been touched.

He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 
look around. Obviously, no one is there.

Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 
refrigerator.

He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 
goes to the bedroom.

His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean 
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 
of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 
puts them in the toaster.

Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun 
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

BUTCH
(softly)
Holy shit.

He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 
it.

Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 
knowing what to do.

The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 
"MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

Vincent freezes.

Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 
direction.

Neither man opens his mouth.

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

That's all the situation needed.

Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets 
SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him 
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door 
at the end of the bathroom.

By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 
is annihilated.

Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 
Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 
back on the kitchen counter.

Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the 
courtyard...

...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

...goes through the alley...

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

EXT. HONDA – DAY

Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide 
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY

The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his 
apartment building.

INT. HONDA – DAY

Butch looks out the window at his former home.

BUTCH
That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 
Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 
ya.

This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips 
a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he 
SINGS along with it.

He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on 
the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we 
see:

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, 
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam 
cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street 
in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see 
Marsellus clearly.

Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front 
of him.

When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances 
to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. 
He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts 
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold 
Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending 
it up on the sidewalk.

Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what 
at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his 
nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. 
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

PEDESTRIAN
Jesus, are you okay?

Butch look at him, spaced-out.

BUTCH
I guess.

Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS 
gather around the body.

GAWKER #1
(to the others)
He's dead! He's dead!

This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

GAWKER #2
If you need a witness in court, I'll 
be glad to help. He was a drunken 
maniac. He hit you and crashed into 
that car.

MARSELLUS
(still incoherent)
Who?

GAWKER #2
(pointing at Butch)
Him.

Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge 
down the street, looking a shambles.

MARSELLUS
Well, I'll be damned.

The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back 
away.

Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward 
him.

BUTCH
Sacre bleu.

Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, 
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, 
screaming.

LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
Oh my God, I've been shot!

That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

Marsellus RUNS after him.

The CROWD looks agape.

Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a 
sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter 
of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of 
Butch RACES into his world.

MAYNARD
Can I help you wit' somethin'?

BUTCH
Shut up!

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands 
next to the door.

MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute 
–

Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. 
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist 
in Marsellus' face.

The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man 
FALLS FLAT on his back.

Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in 
the face.

Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold 
of his middle finger.

BUTCH
So you like chasing people, huh?

He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch 
then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS 
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to 
shield the splatter.

BUTCH
Well guess what, big man, you caught 
me –

MAYNARD (O.S.)
– hold it right there, godammit!

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a 
pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

BUTCH
Look mister, this ain't any of your 
business –

MAYNARD
– I'm makin' it my business! Now 
toss that gun!

Butch does.

MAYNARD
Now you on top, stand up and come to 
the counter.

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he 
gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face 
with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on 
the counter and moves to the telephone.

Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily 
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on 
the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

MAYNARD
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just 
caught a coupl'a flies.

Marsellus passes out.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are 
two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and 
a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are 
unconscious.

Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both 
guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two 
prisoners look up at their captors.

Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one 
hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in 
his belt.

MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of 
business except me or Zed.

A BUZZER buzzes.

MAYNARD
That's Zed.

Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs 
that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed 
inside the store.

Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of 
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking 
in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, 
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both 
share at what they've gotten themselves into.

Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even 
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. 
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is 
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and 
stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a 
long time, then says:

ZED
(to Maynard)
You said you waited for me?

MAYNARD
I did.

ZED
Then how come they're all beat up?

MAYNARD
They did that to each other. They 
was fightin' when they came in. This 
one was gonna shoot that one.

ZED
(to Butch)
You were gonna shoot him?

Butch makes no reply.

ZED
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front 
of this place?

MAYNARD
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

ZED
No, it's Thursday.

MAYNARD
Then she'll be fine.

ZED
Bring out The Gimp.

MAYNARD
I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

ZED
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em 
up then, won't you?

Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

MAYNARD
(yelling in the hole)
Wake up!

Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a 
leash.

He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises 
THE GIMP.

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black 
leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs 
here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather 
mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. 
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large 
dog.

Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, 
then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, 
then backs away.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Down!

The Gimp gets on its knees.

Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

MAYNARD
Who's first?

ZED
I ain't fer sure yet.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, 
miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his 
finger going back and forth between the two.

Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving 
left to right, then it stops.

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on 
Marsellus.

Zed stands up.

ZED
Wanna do it here?

MAYNARD
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old 
room.

Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old 
room.

Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the 
misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. 
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and 
Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the 
back room, is empty.

As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before 
he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Up!

The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on 
the ceiling.

MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one.

The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into 
Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because 
suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath 
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history 
of comedy.

From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight 
in 'em!

We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

ZED (O.S.)
You wanna fight? You wanna fight? 
Good, I like to fight!

Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, 
hurriedly struggles to get free.

The Gimp is laughing wildly.

The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
That's it... that's it boy, you're 
goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like 
that... that's good.
(grunting faster)
Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! 
Zed goddammit, git over here and 
hold 'em!

Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite 
easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it 
were never connected by a bolt.

The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

THE GIMP
Huhng?

The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. 
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles 
and grunts.

Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S 
PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making 
him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash 
attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then 
silently makes his way through the red curtains.

INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch sneaks to the door.

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected 
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he 
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their 
way with Marsellus.

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in 
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the 
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 
with.

He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards 
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks 
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large 
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots 
what he's been looking for:

A Samurai sword.

It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the 
wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. 
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its 
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten 
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his 
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not 
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems 
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the 
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears 
through the red curtains to take care of business.

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind 
the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY

Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It 
swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched 
positions.

Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden 
horse.

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up 
behind him with the sword.

Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, 
red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see 
Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

BUTCH
Hey hillbilly.

Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across 
the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on 
Zed.

Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword 
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing 
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go 
from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, 
which lies within reach.

Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

BUTCH
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

Zed studies Butch.

Butch looks hard at Zed.

Then a VOICE says:

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Step aside, Butch.

Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, 
holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

KABOOM!!!!

Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the 
used shotgun shell.

Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

BUTCH
You okay?

MARSELLUS
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from 
okay!

Long pause.

BUTCH
What now?

MARSELLUS
What now? Well let me tell you what 
now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
hittin' niggers, who'll go to work 
on homes here with a pair of pliers 
and a blow torch.
(to Zed)
Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I 
ain't through with you by a damn 
sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on 
your ass.

BUTCH
I meant what now, between me and 
you?

MARSELLUS
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell 
ya what now between me an' you. There 
is no me an' you. Not no more.

BUTCH
So we're cool?

MARSELLUS
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I 
ask – two things I ask: Don't tell 
nobody about this. This shit's between 
me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It 
ain't nobody else's business. Two: 
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And 
when you're gone, stay gone.  You've 
lost your Los Angeles privileges.  
Deal?

BUTCH
Deal.

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

MARSELLUS
Go on now, get your ass outta here.

Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

MARSELLUS
(into the phone)
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta 
bit of a situation.

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He 
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, 
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has 
the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys 
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES 
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. 
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY

Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, 
Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a 
BOOM BOX.

EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY

Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE." 
He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the 
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!

BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse 
and let's go!

FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?

BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train 
if we don't split now.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?

BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait 
for you outside.

Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the 
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she 
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?

BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?

BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

FABIENNE
You're hurt?

BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie. 
Hop on.

She doesn't move.

Butch looks at her.

BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

Fabienne starts to cry.

Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the 
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her 
hand.

BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.

FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to 
think dreadful thoughts.

BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was 
breakfast?

FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a 
little)
It was good –

BUTCH
– did you get the blueberry pancakes?

FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry 
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk – 
are you sure you're okay?

BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left 
you, this has been without a doubt 
the single weirdest day of my entire 
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about 
it.

Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

BUTCH
It's a chopper.

FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?

BUTCH
Zed's.

FABIENNE
Who's Zed?

BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the 
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF"

TITLE DISAPPEARS.

Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!

JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized, 
seems appropriate for this situation: 
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
righteous man is beset on all sides 
by the inequities of the selfish and 
the tyranny of evil men..."

FADE UP:

INT. BATHROOM – DAY

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in 
earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except 
this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The 
Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard 
to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly 
CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

JULES (O.S.)
"...blessed is he who, in the name 
of charity and good will, shepherded 
the weak through the valley of 
darkness. And I will strike down 
upon thee with great vengeance and 
furious anger those who attempt to 
poison and destroy my brothers. And 
you will know I am the Lord when I 
lay my vengeance upon you."

BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the 
back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow 
fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough 
to stick their head through that door.

Then he listens to them talk.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Friend of yours?

JULES (O.S.)
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the 
door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around 
is the way to go.

INT. APARTMENT – DAY

The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES 
out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his 
hand cannon.

FOURTH MAN
Die... die... die... die...!

DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion 
crosses his face.

TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, 
none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. 
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're 
as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, 
they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

FOURTH MAN
I don't understand –

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's 
bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits 
down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs 
it off.

Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

VINCENT
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about 
that guy in the bathroom? Slip your 
mind?  Forget he was in there with a 
goddamn hand cannon?

JULES
(to himself)
We should be fuckin' dead right now.
(pause)
Did you see that gun he fired at us? 
It was bigger than him.

VINCENT
.357.

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead!

VINCENT
Yeah, we were lucky.

Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

JULES
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was 
somethin' else.

Vincent prepares to leave.

VINCENT
Yeah, maybe.

JULES
That was... divine intervention. You 
know what divine intervention is?

VINCENT
Yeah, I think so. That means God 
came down from Heaven and stopped 
the bullets.

JULES
Yeah, man, that's what is means. 
That's exactly what it means! God 
came down from Heaven and stopped 
the bullets.

VINCENT
I think we should be going now.

JULES
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do 
that!  Don't blow this shit off! 
What just happened was a fuckin' 
miracle!

VINCENT
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit 
happens.

JULES
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just 
happen.

VINCENT
Do you wanna continue this theological 
discussion in the car, or at the 
jailhouse with the cops?

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead now, my 
friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, 
and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge 
it!

VINCENT
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we 
leave now?

EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and 
Marvin in the back.

VINCENT
...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 
was watchin' it once and this cop 
was on it who was talkin' about this 
time he got into this gun fight with 
a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 
this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 
And these guys were in a hallway. 
It's a freak, but it happens.

JULES
If you wanna play blind man, then go 
walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 
eyes are wide fuckin' open.

VINCENT
What the fuck does that mean?

JULES
That's it for me. For here on in, 
you can consider my ass retired.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

JULES
Don't blaspheme!

VINCENT
Goddammit, Jules –

JULES
– I said don't do that –

VINCENT
– you're fuckin' freakin' out!

JULES
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm 
through.

VINCENT
While you're at it, be sure to tell 
'im why.

JULES
Don't worry, I will.

VINCENT
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he 
laughs his ass off.

JULES
I don't give a damn if he does.

Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his 
grip.

VINCENT
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

MARVIN
I don't even have an opinion.

VINCENT
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 
down from Heaven and stopped the 
bullets?

Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES 
blood and SHAKES.

JULES
What the fuck's happening?

VINCENT
I just accidentally shot Marvin in 
the throat.

JULES
Why the fuck did you do that?

VINCENT
I didn't mean to do it. I said it 
was an accident.

JULES
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in 
my time –

VINCENT
– chill out, man, it was an accident, 
okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 
and the gun went off.

JULES
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 
bump!

VINCENT
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this 
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went 
off, don't ask me how!

JULES
Look at this mess! We're drivin' 
around on a city street in broad 
daylight –

VINCENT
– I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' 
about the splatter.

JULES
Well you better be thinkin' about it 
now, motherfucker! We gotta get this 
car off the road. Cops tend to notice 
shit like you're driving a car 
drenched in fuckin' blood.

VINCENT
Can't we just take it to a friendly 
place?

JULES
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus 
don't got no friendly places in the 
Valley.

VINCENT
Well, don't look at me, this is your 
town, Jules.

Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

VINCENT
Who ya callin'?

JULES
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

VINCENT
Where's Toluca Lake.

JULES
On the other side of the hill, by 
Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass 
ain't home, I don't know what the 
fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any 
other partners in 818.
(into phone)
Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
(pause)
Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are 
in some serious shit. We're in a car 
we gotta get off the road, pronto! I 
need to use your garage for a couple 
hours.

INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY

Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while 
Vincent stands behind him.

JULES
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate 
with this Jimmie's situation. He's 
one remark away from kickin' our 
asses out the door.

VINCENT
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

JULES
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made 
a couple phone calls. But I never 
want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's 
my friend and you don't bust in your 
friend's house and start tellin' 'im 
what's what.

Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at 
the sink.

VINCENT
Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He 
kinda freaked out back there when he 
saw Marvin.

JULES
Put yourself in his position. It's 
eight o'clock in the morning. He 
just woke up, he wasn't prepared for 
this shit. Don't forget who's doin' 
who a favor.

Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

VINCENT
If the price of that favor is I gotta 
take shit, he can stick his favor 
straight up his ass.

When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is 
stained with red.

JULES
What the fuck did you just do to his 
towel?

VINCENT
I was just dryin' my hands.

JULES
You're supposed to wash 'em first.

VINCENT
You watched me wash 'em.

JULES
I watched you get 'em wet.

VINCENT
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to 
get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, 
I coulda done a better job.

JULES
I used the same soap you did and 
when I dried my hands, the towel 
didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie 
pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who 
cares? But it's shit like this that's 
gonna bring this situation to a boil. 
If he were to come in here and see 
that towel like that... I'm tellin' 
you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause 
if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie 
on account of you... Look, I ain't 
threatenin' you, I respect you an' 
all, just don't put me in that 
position.

JULES
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no 
problem. He's your friend, you handle 
him.

INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug 
of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in 
his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

JULES
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious 
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda 
been satisfied with freeze-dried 
Tasters Choice. You spring this 
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What 
flavor is this?

JIMMIE
Knock it off, Julie.

JULES
What?

JIMMIE
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can 
stop butterin' me up. I don't need 
you to tell me how good my coffee 
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know 
how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie 
goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy 
the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause 
when I drink it, I wanna taste it. 
But what's on my mind at this moment 
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's 
the dead nigger in my garage.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a 
question, Jules. When you drove in 
here, did you notice a sign out front 
that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him –

JIMMIE
– answer to question. Did you see a 
sign out in front of my house that 
said, "Dead nigger storage?"

JULES
(playing along)
Naw man, I didn't.

JIMMIE
You know why you didn't see that 
sign?

JULES
Why?

JIMMIE
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my 
fuckin' business!

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

JIMMIE
– I ain't through! Now don't you 
understand that if Bonnie comes home 
and finds a dead body in her house, 
I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage 
counselor, no trial separation – 
fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna 
get fuckin' divorced. The last time 
me an' Bonnie talked about this shit 
was gonna be the last time me an' 
Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I 
wanna help ya out Julie, I really 
do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife 
doin' it.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I 
can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' 
you can say that's gonna make me 
forget I love my wife. Now she's 
workin' the graveyard shift at the 
hospital. She'll be comin' home in 
less than an hour and a half. Make 
your phone calls, talk to your people, 
than get the fuck out of my house.

JULES
That's all we want. We don't wanna 
fuck up your shit. We just need to 
call our people to bring us in.

JIMMIE
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's 
in my bedroom.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING

Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy 
robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

MARSELLUS
...well, say she comes home. Whaddya 
think she'll do?
(pause)
No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That 
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, 
I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

JULES
You got to appreciate what an 
explosive element this Bonnie 
situation is. If she comes home from 
a hard day's work and finds a bunch 
of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' 
shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' 
what she's apt to do.

MARSELLUS
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm 
doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

JULES
I don't wanna hear about no 
motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna 
hear from your ass is: "you ain't 
got no problems, Jules. I'm on the 
motherfucker. Go back in there, chill 
them niggers out and wait for the 
cavalry, which should be comin' 
directly."

MARSELLUS
You ain't got no problems, Jules. 
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in 
there, chill them niggers out and 
wait for The Wolf, who should be 
comin' directly.

JULES
You sendin' The Wolf?

MARSELLUS
Feel better?

JULES
Shit Negro, that's all you had to 
say.

INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING

The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite 
into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a 
fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in 
fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: 
Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the 
tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The 
Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
Is she the hysterical type?
(pause)
When she due?
(jotting down)
Give me the principals' names again?
(jots down)
Jules...

We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

"1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) 
Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

THE WOLF
...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

HE WRITES:

"Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

THE WOLF
Expect a call around 10:30. It's 
about thirty minutes away. I'll be 
there in ten.

He hangs up. We never see his face.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

CUT TO:

EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING

A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, 
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a 
dime in front of Jimmie's house.

A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING

Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the 
tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at 
Jimmie.

THE WOLF
You're Jimmie, right? This is your 
house?

JIMMIE
Yeah.

THE WOLF
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

JIMMIE
Good, 'cause we got one.

THE WOLF
So I heard. May I come in?

JIMMIE
Please do.

In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

THE WOLF
You must be Jules, which would make 
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass 
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed 
correctly, the clock is ticking, is 
that right, Jimmie?

JIMMIE
100%.

THE WOLF
Your wife, Bonnie...
(refers to his pad)
...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is 
that correct?

JIMMIE
Uh-huh.

THE WOLF
I was led to believe if she comes 
home and finds us here, she wouldn't 
appreciate it none too much.

JIMMIE
She won't at that.

THE WOLF
That gives us forty minutes to get 
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you 
do what I say when I say it, should 
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a 
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take 
me to it.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He 
studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, 
circling it.

THE WOLF
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Yes.

THE WOLF
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I 
smelled some coffee in there. Would 
you make me a cup?

JIMMIE
Sure, how do you take it?

THE WOLF
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

THE WOLF
About the car, is there anything I 
need to know? Does it stall, does it 
make a lot of noise, does it smoke, 
is there gas in it, anything?

JULES
Aside from how it looks, the car's 
cool.

THE WOLF
Positive?  Don't get me out on the 
road and I find out the brake lights 
don't work.

JULES
Hey man, as far as I know, the 
motherfucker's tip-top.

THE WOLF
Good enough, let's go back to the 
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN – MORNING

Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

THE WOLF
Thank you, Jimmie.

He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the 
three men the plan of action.

THE WOLF
Okay first thing, you two.
(meaning Jules and 
Vincent)
Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 
domesticated house. That would lead 
me to believe that in the garage or 
under the sink, you got a bunch of 
cleansers and cleaners and shit like 
that, am I correct?

JIMMIE
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

THE WOLF
Good. What I need you two fellas to 
do is take those cleaning products 
and clean the inside of the car. And 
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 
need to go in the backseat, scoop up 
all those little pieces of brain and 
skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 
down the upholstery – now when it 
comes to upholstery, it don't need 
to be spic and span, you don't need 
to eat off it. Give it a good once 
over. What you need to take care of 
are the really messy parts. The pools 
of blood that have collected, you 
gotta soak that shit up.  But the 
windows are a different story.  Them 
you really clean. Get the Windex, do 
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 
raid your linen closet. I need 
blankets, I need comforters, I need 
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 
the better, the darker the better. 
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 
camouflage the interior of the car. 
We're gonna line the front seat and 
the backseat and the floor boards 
with quilts and blankets. If a cop 
stops us and starts stickin' his big 
snout in the car, the subterfuge 
won't last. But at a glance, the car 
will appear to be normal.  Jimmie – 
lead the way, boys – get to work.

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving 
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

VINCENT
(calling after him)
A "please" would be nice.

The Wolf stops and turns around.

THE WOLF
Come again?

VINCENT
I said a "please" would be nice.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

THE WOLF
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not 
here to say "please."I'm here to 
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you 
possess, you better fuckin' do it 
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa 
luck gentlemen.

JULES
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your 
help is definitely appreciated.

VINCENT
I don't mean any disrespect. I just 
don't like people barkin' orders at 
me.

THE WOLF
If I'm curt with you, it's because 
time is a factor. I think fast, I 
talk fast, and I need you guys to 
act fast if you want to get out of 
this. So pretty please, with sugar 
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he 
has.

The Wolf is on the phone.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
(pause)
White.
(pause)
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
(pause)
About twenty minutes.
(pause)
Nobody who'll be missed.
(pause)
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?

Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

JIMMIE
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand 
somethin' –

THE WOLF
– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.

JIMMIE
You gotta understand something, 
Winston. I want to help you guys out 
and all, but that's my best linen. 
It was a wedding present from my 
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and 
they ain't with us anymore –

THE WOLF
– let me ask you a question, if you 
don't mind?

JIMMIE
Sure.

THE WOLF
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny 
millionaires?

JIMMIE
No.

THE WOLF
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And 
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and 
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they 
would've furnished you with a whole 
bedroom set, which your Uncle 
Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of 
bills)
I like oak myself, that's what's in 
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, 
you an oak man?

JIMMIE
Oak's nice.

INT. GARAGE – MORNING

Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. 
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is 
in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs 
of brain.

Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

JULES
I will never forgive your ass for 
this shit. This is some fucked-up 
repugnant shit!

VINCENT
Did you ever hear the philosophy 
that once a man admits he's wrong, 
he's immediately forgiven for all 
wrong-doings?

JULES
Man, get outta my face with that 
shit! The motherfucker who said that 
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces 
of skull with his fingers on account 
of your dumb ass.

VINCENT
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a 
threshold for the abuse I'll take. 
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race 
car and you got me in the red. Redline 
7000, that's where you are. Just 
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be 
drivin' a race car when it's in the 
red. It could blow.

JULES
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a 
mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!  
Every time my fingers touch brain 
I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS 
OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker 
usta talk about. In fact, what the 
fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're 
the motherfucker should be on brain 
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' 
windows and you're pickin' up this 
nigger's skull.

INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING

The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with 
bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a 
portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript 
vehicle.

The Wolf circles the car examining it.

Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a 
bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a 
good job they've done.

THE WOLF
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out 
of this yet.

JIMMIE
I can't believe that's the same car.

THE WOLF
Well, let's not start suckin' each 
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one 
is complete, clean the car, which 
moves us right along to phase two, 
clean you two.

EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING

Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, 
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic 
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one 
of those guns nozzles attached.

THE WOLF
Strip.

VINCENT
All the way?

THE WOLF
To your bare ass.

As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about 
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.

JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.

VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely 
necessary?

THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?

VINCENT
What?

THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew 
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' 
off those bloody rags is absolutely 
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's 
garbage bag.

JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid 
like puttin' that out in front of 
your house for Elmo the garbage man 
to take away.

THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with 
us. Jim, the soap.

He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to 
County before, I'm sure. Here it 
comes.

He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.

The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread 
it around.

The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

THE WOLF
Towel 'em.

Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously 
across their bodies.

THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their 
clothes.

FADE UP ON:

JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They 
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses 
we first met.

THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've 
planned this better. You guys look 
like... what do they look like, 
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of 
dorks.

The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, 
motherfucker.

JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to 
wear them.

JULES
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert 
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and 
jokin' our way into prison. Don't 
make me beg.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. 
The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

THE WOLF
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of 
the road straight. We're going to a 
place called Monster Joe's Truck and 
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter 
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.  
The place is North Hollywood, so a 
few twist and turns aside, we'll be 
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll 
drive the tainted car. Jules, you 
ride with me.  Vincent, you follow 
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the 
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody 
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do 
something.

(TO JULES)
What did I say?

JULES
Don't do shit unless –

THE WOLF
– unless what?

JULES
Unless you do it first.

THE WOLF
Spoken like a true prodigy.
(to Vincent)
How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you 
keep your spurs from jingling and 
jangling?

VINCENT
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went 
off, I dunno how.

THE WOLF
Fair enough.
(he throws Vince his 
car keys)
I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep 
up. If I get my car back any different 
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna 
be disposing of two bodies.

EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING

Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

JULES
We cool?

WINSTON
Like it never happened.

Jules and Vincent bump fists.

WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all 
this will be hers.

RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I 
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, 
I'd be great.  What's with the 
outfits. You guys going to a 
volleyball game?

Winston laughs, the boys groan.

WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. 
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where 
do you live?

VINCENT
Redondo Beach.

JULES
Inglewood.

Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a 
"DEAD ZONE" trance.

WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see... a cab 
ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel.

RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.

WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay 
outta trouble, you crazy kids.

Winston turns to leave.

JULES
Mr. Wolf.

He turns around.

JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

The Wolf smiles.

WINSTON
Call me Winston.

He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect. 
You could lean a lot from those two 
fine specimens. Respect for one's 
elders shows character.

RAQUEL
I have character.

WINSTON
Just because you are a character 
doesn't mean you have character.

RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so 
funny.

The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

The two men left alone look at each other.

JULES
Wanna share a cab?

VINCENT
You know I could go for some 
breakfast.  Want to have breakfast 
with me?

JULES
Sure.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a 
big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. 
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a 
muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a 
refill for both men,

VINCENT
Thanks a bunch.
(to Jules, who's 
nursing his coffee)
Want a sausage?

JULES
Naw, I don't eat pork.

VINCENT
Are you Jewish?

JULES
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig 
on swine.

VINCENT
Why not?

JULES
They're filthy animals. I don't eat 
filthy animals.

VINCENT
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste 
good.

JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin 
pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if 
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy 
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in 
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't 
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got 
enough sense to disregard its own 
feces.

VINCENT
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own 
feces.

JULES
I don't eat dog either.

VINCENT
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be 
a filthy animal?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a 
dog filthy, but they're definitely 
dirty. But a dog's got personality. 
And personality goes a long way.

VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a 
better personality, he's cease to be 
a filthy animal?

JULES
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one 
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd 
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

The two men laugh.

VINCENT
Good for you. Lighten up a little. 
You been sittin' there all quiet.

JULES
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

VINCENT
(mouthful of food)
About what?

JULES
The miracle we witnessed.

VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed 
a freak occurrence.

JULES
Do you know that a miracle is?

VINCENT
An act of God.

JULES
What's an act of God?

VINCENT
I guess it's when God makes the 
impossible possible. And I'm sorry 
Jules, but I don't think what happened 
this morning qualifies.

JULES
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't 
matter. You're judging this thing 
the wrong way. It's not about what. 
It could be God stopped the bullets, 
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found 
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge 
shit like this based on merit. Whether 
or not what we experienced was an 
according-to-Hoyle miracle is 
insignificant. What is significant 
is I felt God's touch, God got 
involved.

VINCENT
But why?

JULES
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I 
don't know why. But I can't go back 
to sleep.

VINCENT
So you're serious, you're really 
gonna quit?

JULES
The life, most definitely.

Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In 
the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

PATRON
Garcon! Coffee!

We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene 
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

VINCENT
So if you're quitting the life, 
what'll you do?

JULES
That's what I've been sitting here 
contemplating. First, I'm gonna 
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, 
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

VINCENT
What do you mean, walk the earth?

JULES
You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." 
Just walk from town to town, meet 
people, get in adventures.

VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the 
earth?

JULES
Until God puts me where he want me 
to be.

VINCENT
What if he never does?

JULES
If it takes forever, I'll wait 
forever.

VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum?

JULES
I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no 
more, no less.

VINCENT
No Jules, you're gonna be like those 
pieces of shit out there who beg for 
change. They walk around like a bunch 
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in 
garbage bins, they eat what I throw 
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got 
a word for 'em, they're called bums. 
And without a job, residence, or 
legal tender, that's what you're 
gonna be – a fuckin' bum!

JULES
Look my friend, this is just where 
me and you differ –

VINCENT
– what happened was peculiar – no 
doubt about it – but it wasn't water 
into wine.

JULES
All shapes and sizes, Vince.

VINCENT
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

JULES
If you find my answers frightening, 
Vincent, you should cease askin' 
scary questions.

VINCENT
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

Vincent exits for the restroom.

Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin 
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
I'll execute every one of you 
motherfuckers!  Got that?!

Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the 
table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it 
out, COCKING IT.

PUMPKIN
Customers stay seated, waitresses on 
the floor.

HONEY BUNNY
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, 
do it or fucking die!

Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While 
Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them 
terrified.

PUMPKIN
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out 
here!  Asta luego!

Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

PUMPKIN
On the floor or I'll cook you ass, 
comprende?

They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

MANAGER
I'm the manager here, there's no 
problem, no problem at all –

Pumpkin heads his way.

PUMPKIN
You're gonna give me a problem?

He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the 
Manager's neck.

PUMPKIN
What? You said you're gonna give me 
a problem?

MANAGER
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you 
any problem!

PUMPKIN
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks 
like the hero type to me!

HONEY BUNNY
Don't take any chances. Execute him!

The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his 
hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

MANAGER
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm 
just a coffee shop manager. Take 
anything you want.

PUMPKIN
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll 
be all over.

MANAGER
Everybody just be calm and cooperate 
with them and this will be all over 
soon!

PUMPKIN
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass 
on the ground.

INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, 
reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from 
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter 
with a trash bag in his hand.

PUMPKIN
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round 
and collect your wallets. Don't talk, 
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his 
.45 ready to spit under the table.

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, 
briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more 
respectful, him manner more on guard.

PUMPKIN
In the bag.

Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, 
Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

PUMPKIN
What's in that?

JULES
My boss' dirty laundry.

PUMPKIN
You boss makes you do his laundry?

JULES
When he wants it clean.

PUMPKIN
Sounds like a shit job.

JULES
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same 
thing.

PUMPKIN
Open it up.

Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

JULES
'Fraid I can't do that.

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the 
gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the 
hammer.

PUMPKIN
I didn't hear you.

JULES
Yes, you did.

This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard 
it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

HONEY BUNNY
What's goin' on?

PUMPKIN
Looks like we got a vigilante in our 
midst.

HONEY BUNNY
Shoot 'em in the face!

JULES
I don't mean to shatter your ego, 
but this ain't the first time I've 
had gun pointed at me.

PUMPKIN
You don't open up that case, it's 
gonna be the last.

MANAGER
(on the ground)
Quit causing problems, you'll get us 
all killed! Give 'em what you got 
and get 'em out of here.

JULES
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat 
man, this ain't any of your goddamn 
business!

PUMPKIN
I'm countin' to three, and if your 
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna 
unload right in your fuckin' face. 
Clear? One...

PUMPKIN
...two... three.

JULES
You win.

Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

JULES
It's all yours, Ringo.

PUMPKIN
Open it.

Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to 
Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. 
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across 
the room, can't see shit.

HONEY BUNNY
What is it? What is it?

PUMPKIN
(softly)
Is that what I think it is?

Jules nods his head: "yes."

PUMPKIN
It's beautiful.

Jules nods his head: "yes."

HONEY BUNNY
Goddammit, what is it?

Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering 
the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to 
pick up the case.

Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of 
Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand 
comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 
hand under Pumpkin's chin.

Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow 
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! 
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're 
gonna fuckin' die bad!

JULES
(to Pumpkin)
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, 
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

PUMPKIN
Chill out, honey!

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go!

JULES
(softly)
Tell her it's gonna be okay.

PUMPKIN
I'm gonna be okay.

JULES
Promise her.

PUMPKIN
I promise.

JULES
Tell her to chill.

PUMPKIN
Just chill out.

JULES
What's her name?

PUMPKIN
Yolanda.

Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only 
at Pumpkin.

JULES
(to Yolanda)
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna 
do anything stupid, are we?

YOLANDA
(crying)
Don't you hurt him.

JULES
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're 
gonna be like three Fonzies. And 
what' Fonzie like?

No answer.

JULES
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

YOLANDA
(through tears, unsure)
He's cool?

JULES
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're 
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
(to Pumpkin)
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three 
and I want you to let go your gun 
and lay your palms flat on the table. 
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

Pumpkin looks at him.

JULES
One... two... three.

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

YOLANDA
Okay, now let him go!

JULES
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be 
cool.  When you yell at me, it makes 
me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 
get scared. And when motherfuckers 
get scared, that's when motherfuckers 
get accidentally shot.

YOLANDA
(more conversational)
Just know: you hurt him, you die.

JULES
That seems to be the situation. Now 
I don't want that and you don't want 
that and Ringo here don't want that. 
So let's see what we can do.
(to Ringo)
Now this is the situation. Normally 
both of your asses would be dead as 
fuckin' fried chicken. But you 
happened to pull this shit while I'm 
in a transitional period. I don't 
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 
But I'm afraid I can't give you the 
case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 
I went through too much shit this 
morning on account of this case to 
just hand it over to your ass.

VINCENT (O.S.)
What the fuck's goin' on here?

Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at 
Yolanda.

JULES
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't 
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's 
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're 
still just talkin'.
(to Pumpkin)
Tell her we're still cool.

PUMPKIN
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still 
cool.

VINCENT
(gun raised)
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

JULES
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you 
to just hang back and don't do shit 
unless it's absolutely necessary.

VINCENT
Check.

JULES
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

YOLANDA
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

JULES
Just hang in there, baby, you're 
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you 
and so am I.  It's almost over.
(to Pumpkin)
Now I want you to go in that bag and 
find my wallet.

PUMPKIN
Which one is it?

JULES
It's the one that says Bad 
Motherfucker on it.

Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet 
with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

JULES
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open 
it up and take out the cash. How 
much is there?

PUMPKIN
About fifteen hundred dollars.

JULES
Put it in your pocket, it's yours. 
Now with the rest of them wallets 
and the register, that makes this a 
pretty successful little score.

VINCENT
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen 
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on 
general principle.

JULES
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, 
now hang back and shut the fuck up. 
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. 
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. 
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

PUMPKIN
What?

JULES
Your life. I'm givin' you that money 
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You 
read the Bible?

PUMPKIN
Not regularly.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized. 
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
righteous man is beset on all sides 
by the inequities of the selfish and 
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
he who, in the name of charity and 
good will, shepherds the weak through 
the valley of the darkness. For he 
is truly his brother's keeper and 
the finder of lost children. And I 
will strike down upon thee with great 
vengeance and furious anger those 
who attempt to poison and destroy my 
brothers. And you will know I am the 
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 
you." I been sayin' that shit for 
years.  And if you ever heard it, it 
meant your ass. I never really 
questioned what it meant. I thought 
it was just a coldblooded thing to 
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 
a cap in his ass. But I saw some 
shit this mornin' made me think twice. 
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 
the evil man. And I'm the righteous 
man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 
shepherd protecting my righteous ass 
in the valley of darkness. Or is 
could by you're the righteous man 
and I'm the shepherd and it's the 
world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 
like that. But that shit ain't the 
truth. The truth is you're the weak. 
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 
be a shepherd.

Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to 
Yolanda.

She looks back.

Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the 
door.

Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, 
takes a sip of coffee.

JULES
(to himself)
It's cold.

He pushes it aside.

Vincent appears next to Jules.

VINCENT
I think we oughta leave now.

JULES
That's probably a good idea.

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the 
briefcase.

Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the 
Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes 
– wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, 
swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of 
the coffee shop together without saying a word.

FADE OUT

THE END
FADE IN:
INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING

Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
breakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and
are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a
small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and
involved story about Madonna.

MR. PINK 
"Like a Virgin" is all about a
girl who digs a guy with a big
dick.  The whole song is a
metaphor for big dicks.

MR. BLUE
No it's not.  It's about a girl
who is very vulnerable and she's
been fucked over a few times.
Then she meets some guy who's
really sensitive--

MR. PINK
--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
Tell that bullshit to the
tourists.

JOE
(looking through his
address book)
Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
Toby...Toby...think...think...
think...

MR. PINK
It's not about a nice girl who
meets a sensitive boy.  Now
granted that's what "True Blue" is
about, no argument about that.

MR. ORANGE
Which one is "True Blue?"

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't remember "True Blue?"
That was a big ass hit for
Madonna.  Shit, I don't even
follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
I've at least heard of "True
Blue."

MR. ORANGE
Look, asshole, I didn't say I
ain't heard of it.  All I asked
was how does it go?  Excuse me
for not being the world's biggest
Madonna fan.

MR. BROWN
I hate Madonna.

MR. BLUE
I like her early stuff.  You know,
"Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
once she got into her "Papa Don't
Preach" phase, I don't know, I
tuned out.

MR. PINK
Hey, fuck all that, I'm
making a point here.  You're gonna
make me lose my train
of thought.

JOE
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
girl.

MR. WHITE
What's that?

JOE
I found this old address book in a
jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
age.  Toby what?  What the fuck
was her last name?

MR. PINK
Where was I?

MR. ORANGE
You said "True Blue" was about a
nice girl who finds a sensitive
fella.  But "Like a Virgin" was a
metaphor for big dicks.

MR. PINK
Let me tell ya what "Like a
Virgin"'s about.  It's about some
cooze who's a regular fuck
machine.
I mean all the time, morning, day,
night, afternoon, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick.

MR. BLUE
How many dicks was that?

MR. WHITE
A lot.

MR. PINK
Then one day she meets a John
Holmes motherfucker, and it's
like, whoa baby.  This mother
fucker's like Charles Bronson in
"The Great Escape."  He's diggin
tunnels.  Now she's gettin this
serious dick action, she's feelin
something she ain't felt since
forever.  Pain.

JOE
Chew?  Toby Chew?  No.

MR. PINK
It hurts.  It hurts her.  It
shouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should
be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when
this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It
hurts like the first time.  The
pain is reminding a fuck machine
what is was like to be a virgin.
Hence, "Like a Virgin."

The fellas crack up.

JOE
Wong?

MR. PINK
Fuck you, wrong.  I'm right!  What
the fuck do you know about it
anyway?  You're still listening to
Jerry-fucking-Vale.

JOE
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You
know, like the Chinese name?

Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They
fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

MR. WHITE
Give me this fucking thing.

JOE
What the fuck do you think you're
doin?  Give me my book back!

MR. WHITE
I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
I'll give it back when we leave.

JOE
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
we leave, give it back now.

MR. WHITE
For the past fifteen minutes now,
you've just been droning on with
names.  "Toby...Toby...Toby...
Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan."  I
got Madonna's big dick outta my
right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-
know-what, outta my left.

JOE
What do you care?

MR. WHITE
When you're annoying as hell, I
care a lot.

JOE
Give me my book.

MR. WHITE
You gonna put it away?

JOE
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
with it.

MR. WHITE
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to keep it.

MR. BLONDE
Joe, you want me to shoot him for
you?

MR. WHITE
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologize.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Have you guys been listening to K-
BILLY's super sounds of the
seventies weekend?

MR. PINK
Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?

NICE GUY EDDIE
Can you believe the songs they
been playin?

MR. PINK
No, I can't.  You know what I
heard the other day?  "Heartbeat -
It's Lovebeat," by little Tony
DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
I haven't heard that since I was
in fifth fuckin grade.

NICE GUY EDDIE
When I was coming down here, I was
playin it.  And "The Night the
Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
on.  Now I ain't heard that song
since it was big, but when it was
big, I heard it a million-
trillion times.  I'm listening to
it this morning, and this was the
first time I ever realized that
the lady singing the song, was the
one who killed Andy.

MR. BLUE
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
killed the guy?

NICE GUY EDDIE
I thought the cheatin wife shot
Andy.

MR. BLONDE
They say it in the song.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I know, I heard it.  I musta zoned
out whenever that part came on
before.  I thought when she said
that little sister stuff, she was
talkin about her sister- in-law,
the cheatin wife.

JOE
No, she did it.  She killed the
cheatin wife, too.

MR. PINK
You know the part in "Gypsies,
Tramps and Theives," when she says
"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
what he'd done?"  I could never
figure out what he did.

The table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.
She has the check, and a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody more
coffee.

JOE
No, we're gonna be hittin it.
I'll take care of the check.

She hands the bill to him.

WAITRESS
Here ya go.  Please pay at the
register, if you wouldn't mind.

JOE
Sure thing.

WAITRESS
You guys have a wonderful day.

They all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.

JOE
I'll take care of this, you guys
leave the tip.
(to Mr. White)
And when I come back, I want my
book back.

MR. WHITE
Sorry, it's my book now.

JOE
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
will ya?

Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White
acts shot.  Joe exits.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Okay, everybody cough up green for
the little lady.

Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.

NICE GUY EDDIE
C'mon, throw in a buck.

MR. WHITE
Uh-uh.  I don't tip.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

MR. WHITE
I don't believe in it.

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't believe in tipping?

MR. PINK
(laughing)
I love this kid, he's a madman,
this guy.

MR. BLONDE
Do you have any idea what these
ladies make?  They make shit.

MR. WHITE
Don't give me that.  She don't
make enough money, she can quit.

Everybody laughs.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I don't even know a Jew who'd have
the balls to say that.  So let's
get this straight. You never ever
tip?

MR. WHITE
I don't tip because society says I
gotta.  I tip when somebody
deserves a tip.  When somebody
really puts forth an effort, they
deserve a little something extra.
But this tipping automatically,
that shit's for the birds.  As far
as I'm concerned, they're just
doin their job.

MR. BLUE
Our girl was nice.

MR. WHITE
Our girl was okay.  She didn't do
anything special.

MR. BLONDE
What's something special, take ya
in the kitchen and suck your dick?

They all laugh.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I'd go over twelve percent for
that.

MR. WRITE
Look, I ordered coffee.  Now we've
been here a long fuckin time, and
she's only filled my cup three
times.  When I order coffee,  I
want it filled six times.

MR. BLONDE
What if she's too busy?

MR. WHITE
The words "too busy" shouldn't be
in a waitress's vocabulary.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
thing you need is another cup of
coffee.

They all laugh.

MR. WHITE
These ladies aren't starvin to
death.  They make minimum wage.
When I worked for minimum wage, I
wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tipworthy.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
It's not just that he's a cheap
bastard--

MR. ORANGE
--It is that too--

NICE GUY EDDIE
--It is that too.  But it's also
he couldn't get a waiter job.  You
talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
"Fuck those cunts and their
fucking tips."

MR. BLONDE
So you don't care that they're
counting on your tip to live?

Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.

MR. WHITE
Do you know what this is?  It's
the world's smallest violin,
playing just for the waitresses.

MR. BLONDE
You don't have any idea what
you're talking about.  These
people bust their ass. This
is a hard job.

MR. WHITE
So's working at McDonald's, but
you don't feel the need to tip
them.  They're servin ya food, you
should tip em.  But no, society
says tip these guys over here, but
not those guys over there.  That's
bullshit.

MR. ORANGE
They work harder than the kids at
McDonald's.

MR. WHITE
Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
fryers.

MR. BROWN
These people are taxed on the tips
they make.  When you stiff 'em,
you cost them money.

MR. BLONDE
Waitressing is the number one
occupation for female non-college
graduates in this country.  It's
the one jab basically any woman
can get, and make a living on.
The reason is because of tips.

MR. WHITE
Fuck all that.

They all laugh.

MR. WHITE
Hey, I'm very sorry that the
government taxes their tips.
That's fucked up.  But that ain't
my fault.  it would appear that
waitresses are just one of the
many groups the government fucks
in the ass on a regular basis.
You show me a paper says the
government shouldn't do that, I'll
sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll
vote for it.  But what I won't do
is play ball.  And this non-
college bullshit you're telling
me, I got two words for that:
"Learn to fuckin type."  Cause if
you're expecting me to help out
with the rent, you're in for a big
fuckin surprise.

MR. ORANGE
He's convinced me.  Give me my
dollar back.

Everybody laughs.  Joe's comes back to the table.

JOE
Okay ramblers, let's get to
rambling.  Wait a minute, who
didn't throw in?

MR. ORANGE
Mr. White.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Mr. White?
(to Mr. White)
Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't tip.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't tip?
(to Mr. White)
You don't tip?  Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't believe in it.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't believe in it?
(to Mr. White)
You don't believe in it?

MR. ORANGE
Nope.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Shut up!
(to Mr. White)
Cough up the buck, ya cheap
bastard, I paid for your goddamn
breakfast.

MR. WHITE
Because you paid for the
breakfast, I'm gonna tip.
Normally I wouldn't.

JOE
Whatever.  Just throw in your
dollar, and let's move.
(to Mr. Blonde)
See what I'm dealing with here.
Infants.  I'm fuckin dealin with
infants.

The eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in
the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,
talking amongst themselves.


EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

When the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:

Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
agony.

Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
ASS, through traffic.

Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
ELSE SAY:

SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.

Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

SOMEBODY (OS)
I'm sorry.  I can't believe
she killed me.  Who would've
fuckin thought that?

CUT TO:

INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the
backseat.  He's been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers
both him and the backseat.

Mr. White is the Somebody Else.  He's behind the wheel of
the getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
out of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he
keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

They are the only two in the car.

MR. WHITE
Hey, just cancel that shit right
now!  You're hurt.  You're hurt
really fucking bad, but you ain't
dying.

MR. ORANGE
(crying)
All this blood is scaring the shit
outta me.  I'm gonna die, I know
it.

MR. WHITE
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
had a degree in medicine.  Are you
a doctor?  Are you a doctor?
Answer me please, are you a
doctor?

MR. ORANGE
No, I'm not!

MR. WRITE
Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
what you're talking about.  So if
you're through giving me your
amateur opinion, lie back and
listen to the news.  I'm taking
you back to the rendezvous, Joe's
gonna get you a doctor, the
doctor's gonna fix you up, and
you're gonna be okay.  Now say it:
you're gonna be okay.  Say it:
you're gonna be okay!

Mr. Orange doesn't respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on
the steering wheel.

MR. WHITE
Say-the-goddamn-words: you're
gonna be okay!

MR. ORANGE
I'm okay.

MR. WHITE
(softly)
Correct.

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse.  Then the
door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
Mr. Orange inside.

Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

MR. WHITE
Just hold on buddy boy.  Hold on,
and wait for Joe.  I can't do
anything for you, but when Joe
gets here, which should be anytime
now, he'll be able to help you.
We're just gonna sit here, and
wait for Joe.  Who are
we waiting for?

MR. ORANGE
Joe.

MR. WHITE
Bet your sweet ass we are.

Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
around the warehouse.

MR. ORANGE
(yelling)
Don't leave me!

Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

MR. WHITE
I ain't going anywhere.  I'm right
here.  I'm not gonna leave ya.

MR. ORANGE
Larry, I'm so scared, would you
please hold me.

Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.
Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

MR. WHITE
(whispering)
Go ahead and be scared, you've
been brave enough for one day.  I
want you to just relax now.
You're not gonna die, you're gonna
be fine.  When Joe gets here,
he'll make ya a hundred percent
again.

Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He's
still holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his
friend.

MR. ORANGE
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in
the ointment, but if help doesn't
come soon, I gotta see a doctor.
I don't give a fuck about jail, I
just don't wanna die.

MR. WHITE
You're not gonna fucking die, all
right?

MR. ORANGE
I wasn't born yesterday.  I'm
hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

MR. WHITE
It's not good...

MR. ORANGE
Hey, bless your heart for what
you're trying to do.  I was
panicking for a moment, but I've
got my senses back now.  The
situation is, I'm shot in the
belly.  And without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.

MR. WHITE
I can' take you to a hospital.

MR. ORANGE
Fuck jail!  I don't give a shit
about jail.  But I can't die.  You
don't have to take me in.  Just
drive me up to the front, drop me
on the sidewalk.  I'll take care
of myself.  I won't tell them
anything.  I swear to fucking god,
I won't tell 'em anything.  Look
in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
(Mr. White does)
I-won't-tell-them-anything.
You'll be safe.

MR. WHITE
Lie back down, and try to--

MR. ORANGE
I'm going to die!   I need a
doctor!  I'm begging you,
take me to a doctor.

Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from
his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

MR. ORANGE
Take me to a doctor, take me to a
doctor, please.

Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.
Pink steps inside.

MR. PINK
Was that a fucking set-up or what?

Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

MR. PINK
Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

MR. WHITE
Gun shot.

MR. PINK
Oh that's just fucking great!
Where's Brown?

MR. WHITE
Dead.

MR. PINK
Goddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?

MR. WHITE
How the fuck do you think?  The
cops shot him.

MR. PINK
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
(referring to Mr.
Orange)
Is it bad?

MR. WHITE
As opposed to good?

MR. PINK
This is so fucked up.  Somebody
fucked us big time.

MR. WHITE
You really think we were set up?

MR. PINK
You even doubt it?  I don't think
we got set up, I know we got set
up!  I mean really, seriously,
where did all those cops come
from, huh?  One minute they're not
there, the next minute
they're there.  I didn't hear any
sirens.  The alarm went off, okay.
Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
got an average of four minutes
response time.  Unless a patrol
car is cruising that street, at
that particular moment, you got
four minutes before they can
realistically respond.  In one
minute there were seventeen blue
boys out there.  All loaded for
bear, all knowing exactly what the
fuck they were doing, and they
were all just there!  Remember
that second wave that showed up in
the cars? Those were the ones
responding to the alarm.  but
those other motherfuckers were
already there, they were waiting
for us.
(pause)
You haven't thought about this?

MR. WHITE
I haven't had a chance to think.
First I was just trying to get the
fuck outta there.  And after we
got away, I've just been dealin
with him.

MR. PINK
Well, you better start thinking
about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck,
am thinking about it.  In fact,
that's all I'm thinking about.  I
came this close to just driving
off.  Whoever set us up, knows
about this place.  There could've
been cops sitting here waiting for
me.  For all we know, there's
cops, driving fast, on their way
here now.

MR. WHITE
Let's go in the other room...

The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We
move past it, and see down a hall.

INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

At the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door
is partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is
obscured, but Mr. White is in view.

MR. PINK (OS)
What the fuck am I doing here?  I
felt funny about this job right
off.  As soon as I felt it I
should said "No thank you", and
walked.  But I never fucking
listen.  Every time I ever got
burned buying weed, I always knew
the guy wasn't right.  I just felt
it.  But I wanted to believe him.
If he's not lyin to me, and it
really is Thai stick, then whoa
baby.  But it's never Thai stick.
and I always said if I felt that
way about a job, I'd walk.  And I
did, and I didn't, because of
fuckin money!

MR. WHITE
What's done is done, I need you
cool.  Are you cool?

MR. PINK
I'm cool.

MR. WHITE
Splash some water on your face.
Take a breather.

We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
his face.

MR. WHITE
I'm gonna get me my smokes.

Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
OUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards
us, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries
his face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of
Chesterfields in his hand.

MR. WHITE
Want a smoke?

MR. PINK
Why not?

The two men light up.

MR. WHITE
Okay, let's go through what
happened.  We're in the place,
everything's going fine.  Then the
alarm gets tripped.  I turn around
and all these cops are outside.
You're right, it was like, bam!  I
blink my eyes are they're there.
Everybody starts going apeshit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all
the--

MR. PINK
--That's not correct.

MR. WHITE
What's wrong with it?

MR. PINK
The cops didn't show up after the
alarm went off.  They didn't show
till after Mr. Blonde started
shooting everyone.

MR. WHITE
As soon as I heard the alarm, I
saw the cops.

MR. PINK
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that
soon.  They didn't let their
presence be known until after Mr.
Blonde went off.  I'm not sayin
they weren't there, I'm sayin they
were there.  But they didn't move
in till Mr. Blonde became a
madman.  That's how I know we were
set up.  You can see that,
can't you, Mr. White?

MR. WHITE
Look, enough of this "Mr White"
shit--

MR. PINK
--Don't tell me your name, I don't
want to know!  I sure as hell
ain't gonna tell ya
mine.

MR. WHITE
You're right, this is bad.
(pause)
How did you get out?

MR. PINK
Shot my way out.  Everybody was
shooting, so I just blasted my way
outta there.

CUT TO:


EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY

Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.  He has
a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
MAGNUM in the other.  If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
just knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right
along side of him.

FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.  We DOLLY with
them.

We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.  ROLLERGIRL
is plugged into a walkman.  We hear the song she's
listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.  She's twirling and
skating backwards to the beat of the song.

Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.  The
man and woman CRASH to the ground.

Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
him.


INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY

The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the
car's driver.  Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,
shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.

MR. PINK
Get outta the car!  Get the fuck
outta the car!

The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
locked.

MR. PINK
Open the fucking door!

EXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.


EXT. STREET - DAY

DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at
the Cops.

Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

Cops FIRE.


INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it.  SPEEDING down
the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.

BACK TO:


INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
Tagged a couple of cops.  Did you
kill anybody?

MR. WHITE
A few cops.

MR. PINK
No real people?

MR. WHITE
Uh-uh, just cops.

MR. PINK
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

MR. WHITE
That was one of the most insane
fucking things I've ever seen.
Why the fuck would Joe hire
somebody like that?

MR. PINK
I don't wanna kill anybody.  But
if I gotta get out that door, and
you're standing in my way, one way
of the other, you're gettin outta
my way.

MR. WHITE
That's the way I look at it.  A
choice between doin ten years, and
takin out some stupid
motherfucker, ain't no choice at
all.  But I ain't no madman
either.  What the fuck was Joe
thinkin?  You can't work with a
guy like that.  That mother-
fucker's unstable.  What do you
think?  Do you think he panicked,
or ya think he's just trigger-
happy?

MR. PINK
I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!
We're awful goddamn lucky he
didn't tag us, when
he shot up the place.  I came this
fucking close--
(hold up two fingers
and makes a tiny
space between them)
--to taking his ass out myself.
Everybody panics.  When things get
tense, everybody panics.
Everybody.  I don't care what your
name is, you can't help it.  It's
human nature.  But ya panic on the
inside.
Ya panic in your head.  Ya give
yourself a couple a seconds of
panic, then you get a grip and
deal with the situation.  What you
don't do, is shoot up the place
and kill everybody.

MR. WHITE
What you're supposed to do is act
like a fuckin professional.  A
psychopath is not a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath,
'cause ya don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do
you think that black girl was?
Twenty, maybe twenty-one?

MR. PINK
Did ya see what happened to
anybody else?

MR. WHITE
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the
car and Mr. Brown floored it.
After that, I don't know what went
down.

MR. PINK
At that point it became every man
for himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde
or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't
got the foggiest.  Once
I got out, I never looked back.

MR. WHITE
What do you think?

MR. PINK
What do I think?  I think the cops
caught them, or killed 'em.

MR. WHITE
Not even a chance they punched
through?  You found a hole.

MR. PINK
Yeah, and that was a fucking
miracle.  But if they did get
away, where the fuck are they?

MR. WHITE
You don't think it's possible, one
of them got ahold of the diamonds
and pulled a--

MR. PINK
Nope.

MR. WHITE
How can you be so sure?

MR. PINK
I got the diamonds.

MR. WHITE
Where?

MR. PINK
I got 'em, all right?

MR. WHITE
Where?  Are they out in the car?

MR. PINK
No, they're not in the car.  No, I
don't have them on me.  Ya wanna
go with me and get 'em?  Yes, we
can go right now.  But first
listen to what I'm telling you.
We were fuckin set up!  Somebody
is in league with the cops.  We
got a Judas in our midst.  And I'm
thinkin we should have our fuckin
heads examined for waiting around
here.

MR. WHITE
That was the plan, we meet here.

MR. PINK
Then where is everybody?  I say
the plan became null and void once
we found out we got a rat in the
house.  We ain't got the slightest
fuckin idea what happened to Mr.
Blonde or Mr. Blue.  They could
both be dead
or arrested.  They could be
sweatin 'em, down at the station
house right now.  Yeah they don't
know the names, but they can sing
about this place.
I mean, that could be happening
right now.  As we speak, the cops
could be in their cars, drivin
here this minute.

MR. WHITE
I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.

MR. PINK
What?

MR. WHITE
Two jobs back, it was a four man
job, we discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

MR. PINK
No shit?

MR. WHITE
Thank god, we discovered in time.
We hadda forget the whole fuckin
thing.  Just walked away from it.

MR. PINK
So who's the rat this time?  Mr.
Blue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  It's
Joe's show, he set this whole
thing up.  Maybe he set it up to
set it up.

MR. WHITE
I don't buy it.  Me and Joe go
back a long time.  I can tell ya
straight up, Joe definitely didn't
have anything to do with this
bullshit.

MR. PINK
Oh, you and Joe go back a long
time.  I known Joe since I was a
kid.  But me saying Joe definitely
couldn't have done it is
ridiculous.  I can say I
definitely didn't do it, cause I
know what I did or didn't do.  But
I can't definitely say that about
anybody else, 'cause I don't
definitely know.  For all I know,
you're the rat.

MR. WHITE
For all I know, you're the rat.

MR. PINK
Now you're using your head. For
all we know, he's the rat.

Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's
expression changes.

MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!


INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The
CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him
first.

MR. PINK
Is he dead?

Mr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse
on Mr. Orange's neck.

MR. PINK
So, is he dead or what?

MR. WHITE
He ain't dead.

MR. PINK
So what is it?

MR. WHITE
I think he's just passed out.

MR. PINK
He scared the fuckin shit outta
me.  I thought he was dead fer
sure.

Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

MR. WHITE
He will be dead fer sure, if we
don't get him to a hospital.

MR. PINK
We can't take him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE
Without medical attention, this
man won't live through the night.
That bullet in his belly is my
fault.  Now while that might not
mean jack shit to you, it means a
helluva lot to me.  And I'm not
gonna just sit around and watch
him die.

MR. PINK
Well, first things first, staying
here's goofy.  We gotta book up.

MR. WHITE
So what do you suggest, we go to a
hotel?  We got a guy who's shot in
the belly, he can't walk, he
bleeds like a stuck pig, and when
he's awake, he screams in pain.

MR. PINK
You gotta idea, spit it out.

MR. WHITE
Joe could help him.  If we can get
in touch with Joe, Joe could get
him to a doctor, Joe could get a
doctor to come and see him.

During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a 
C.U. of Mr. White.

MR. PINK (OS)
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
gonna get in touch with him?  He's
supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which is making me nervous about
being here.  Even if Joe is
on the up and up, he's probably
not gonna be that happy with us.
Joe planned a robbery, but he's
got a blood bath on his hands now.
Dead cops, dead robbers, dead
civilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend
to doubt he's gonna have a lot of
sympathy for our plight.  If I was
him, I'd try and put as much
distance between me and this mess
an humanly possible.

MR. WHITE
Before you got here, Mr. Orange
was askin me to take him to a
hospital.  Now I don't like
turning him over to the cops, but
if we don't, he's dead.  He begged
me to do it.  I told him to hold
off till Joe got here.

MR. PINK (OS)
Well Joe ain't gettin here.  We're
on our own.  Now, I don't know a
goddamn body who can help him, so
if you know somebody, call 'em.

MR. WHITE
I don't know anybody.

MR. PINK (OS)
Well, I guess we drop him off at
the hospital.  Since he don't know
nothin about us, I say it's his
decision.


MR. WHITE'S POV:

C.U. OF MR. PINK.

MR. WHITE (OS)
Well, he knows a little about me.

MR. PINK
You didn't tell him your name, did
ya?

MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him my first name, and
where I'm from.

There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,
then he SCREAMS:

MR. PINK
Why!

MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him where I was from a few
days ago.  It was just a casual
conversation.

MR. PINK
And what was tellin him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

MR. WHITE (OS)
He asked.

Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

MR. WHITE (OS)
We had just gotten away from the
cops.  He just got shot.  It was
my fuckin fault he got shot.  He's
a fuckin bloody mess - he's
screaming.  I swear to god, I
thought we was gonna die right
then and there.  I'm tryin to
comfort him, telling him not to
worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm
gonna take care of him.  And he
asked me what my name was.  I
mean, the man was dyin in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to
tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out
that information, it's against the
rules.  I don't trust you
enough."?  Maybe I shoulda, but I
couldn't.

MR. PINK
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite
beautiful--

MR. WHITE (OS)
Don't fuckin patronize me.

MR. PINK
One question: Do they have a sheet
on you, where you told him you're
from?

MR. WHITE (OS)
Of course.

MR. PINK
Well that's that, then.  I mean, I
was worried about mug shot
possibilities already.  But now he
knows: (a) what you look like, (b)
what your first name is,
(i) where you're from and (d) what
your specialty is.
They ain't gonna hafta show him a
helluva lot of pictures for him to
pick you out.  That's it right,
you didn't tell him anything else
that could narrow down the
selection?

MR. WHITE (OS)
If I have to tell you again to
back off, me an you are gonna go
round and round.

Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.
White.  Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

MR. PINK
We ain't taking him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE (OS)
If we don't, he'll die.

MR. PINK
And I'm very sad about that.  But
some fellas are lucky, and some
ain't.

MR. WHITE (OS)
That fuckin did it!

Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in
the mouth.

END OF POV

Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and
realistic fight.  They go at each other like a couple of
alley cats.

As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

MR. WHITE

You little motherfucker!

Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

MR. PINK
Ya wanna fuck with me?!  You wanna
fuck with me?!  I'll show you who
you're fuckin with!

The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.

Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
out.

Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
and goes for his own weapon.

The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

MR. WHITE
You wanna shoot me, you little
piece of shit?  Take a shot!

MR. PINK
Fuck you, White!  I didn't create
this situation,  I'm just dealin
with it.  You're acting like a
first-year fuckin thief.  I'm
actin like a professional.  They
get him, they can get you, they
get you, they get closer to me,
and that can't happen.  And you,
you motherfucker, are looking at
me like it's my fault.  I didn't
tell him my name.  I didn't tell
him where I was from.  I didn't
tell him what I knew better than
to tell him.  Fuck, fifteen
minutes ago, you almost told me
your name.  You, buddy, are stuck
in a situation you created.  So if
you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

MR. PINK
So if you wanna shoot somebody,
put that gun in your mouth and
shoot yourself.

Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

VOICE (OS)
You kids don't play so rough.
Somebody's gonna start crying.


INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE

The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke
and eating a hot dog.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blonde!  You okay?  We thought
you might've gotten caught.  What
happened?

Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter
and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the
place out.

He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he
just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

This is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr.
Pink tries to talk through it.

We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

MR. PINK
Really, how did you get away?

Mr. Blonde walks the loft.  Silent.

MR. PINK
You saw what happened to me,
I found a hole and booked.

Silence.

MR. PINK
Where's Mr. Blue?

Blonde looks in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
We were hopin you two would be
together.

Blonde looks out the window.

MR. PINK
That was the big question we had,
what happened to Mr.
Blue and you?

Blonde walks away from the window.

MR. PINK
We were worried the cops got ya.

Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

MR. PINK
He got it in the belly.  He's
still alive, but won't be for
long.

MR. WHITE
Enough!  You better start talkin
to us, asshole, cause we got shit
we need to talk about.  We're
already freaked out, we need you
actin freaky like we need a fuckin
bag on our hip.

Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
towards them.

MR. BLONDE
So, talk.

MR. WHITE
We think we got a rat in the
house.

MR. PINK
I guarantee we got a rat in the
house.

MR. BLONDE
What would ever make you think
that?

MR. WHITE
Is that supposed to be funny?

MR. PINK
We don't think this place is safe.

MR. WHITE
This place just ain't secure
anymore.  We're leaving, and you
should go with us.

MR. BLONDE
Nobody's going anywhere.

Silence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving.

After a few beats the silence is broken.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
Piss on this turd, we're outta
here.

Mr. White turns to leave.

MR. BLONDE
Don't take another step, Mr.
White.

Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards
Mr. Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Fuck you, maniac!  It's your
fuckin fault we're in so much
trouble.

Mr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink.

MR. BLONDE
(referring to Mr.
White)
What's this guy's problem?

MR. WHITE
What's my problem?  Yeah, I gotta
problem.  I gotta big problem with
any trigger-happy madman who
almost gets me shot!

MR. BLONDE
What're you talkin about?

MR. WHITE
That fuckin shooting spree in the
store.

MR. BLONDE
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm,
they deserve what they got.

MR. WHITE
You almost killed me, asshole!  If
I had any idea what type of guy
you were, I never would've agreed
to work with you.

MR. BLONDE
You gonna back all day, little
doggie, or are you gonna bite?

MR. WHITE
What was that?  I'm sorry, I
didn't catch it.  Would you repeat
it?

MR. BLONDE
(slowly)
I said: "Are you gonna bark all
day, dog, or are you gonna bite."

MR. PINK
Both of you two assholes knock it
the fuck off and calm down!

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Blonde)
So you wanna git bit, huh?

MR. PINK
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a
fuckin playground!
(pause)
I don't believe this shit, both of
you got ten years on me, and I'm
the only one actin like a
professional.  You guys act like a
bunch of fuckin niggers.  You ever
work a job with a bunch of
niggers?  They're just like you
two, always fightin, always sayin
they're gonna kill one another.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
You said yourself, you
thought about takin him out.

MR. PINK
Then.  That time has passed.
Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only
one I completely trust.  He's too
fuckin homicidal to be workin with
the cops.

MR. WHITE
You takin his side?

MR. PINK
Fuck sides!  What we need is a
little solidarity here.
Somebody's stickin a red hot poker
up our asses and we gotta find out
whose hand's on the handle.  Now I
know I'm no piece of shit...
(referring to Mr.
White)
And I'm pretty sure you're a good
boy...
(referring to Mr.
Blonde)
And I'm fuckin positive you're on
the level.  So let's figure out
who's the bad guy.

Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,
talking about Madonna.

MR. BLONDE
Well, that was sure exciting.
(to Mr. White)
You're a big Lee Marvin fan,
aren't you?  Me too.  I don't know
about the rest of you fellas, but
my heart's
beatin fast.
(pause for a beat)
Okay you guys, follow me.

Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

MR. WHITE
Follow you where?

MR. BLONDE
Down to my car.

MR. WHITE
Why?

MR. BLONDE
It's a surprise.

Mr. Blonde walks out.


EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars are parked out front.  Mr. Blonde is walking
towards the car he drove.  Mr. White and Mr. Pink are
walking behind.  The Camera is HANDHELD following behind
them.

MR. PINK
We still gotta get out of here.

MR. BLONDE
We're gonna sit here and wait.

MR. WHITE
For what, the cops?

MR. BLONDE
Nice Guy Eddie.

MR. PINK
Nice Guy Eddie?  What makes you
think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a
plane half way to Costa Rica?

MR. BLONDE
Cause I just talked to him.  He's
on his way down here, and nobody's
going anywhere till be gets here.

MR. WHITE
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie?  Why
the fuck didn't you say that in
the first place?

MR. BLONDE
You didn't ask.

MR. WHITE
Hardy-fuckin-har.  What did he
say?

MR. BLONDE
Stay put.  Okay, fellas, take a
look at the little surprise I
brought you.

Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car.  A handcuffed,
uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.

MR. BLONDE
So while we're waitin for Nice Guy
Eddie, what say we have a little
fun finding out who the rat is.


INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. BLONDE".


INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY

We're inside the office of Joe Cabot.  Joe's on the phone,
sitting behind his desk.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, I'm tellin you don't worry
about it.  You had a bad couple of
months, it happens.
(pause)
Sid, Sid, Sid...Stop, you're
embarrassing me.  I don't need to
be told what I already know.  When
you have bad months, you do what
every business man in the
worlds does, I don't care if he's
Donald Trump or Irving the tailor.
Ya ride it out.

There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

JOE
Come in.

One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps
inside.  Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks
towards the man.

TEDDY
Vic Vega's outside.

JOE
Tell him to come in.

Teddy leaves.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, a friend of mine's here.  I
gotta go.
(pause)
Good enough, bye.

He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the
front of the desk.

Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks
in.

Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr.
Blonde.  Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies
style jacket.

Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

The two men embrace each other.  Teddy leaves, closing the
door behind him.

JOE
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin
good, ain't it?

VIC
It's a change.

JOE
Ain't that a sad truth.  Remy
Martin?

VIC
Sure.

JOE
Take a seat.

Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet.  Vic sits in a chair
set in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
(while he pours the
drink)
Who's your parole officer?

VIC
A guy named Koons.  Craig Koons.

JOE
How is he?

VIC
Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave
the halfway house.

JOE
Never ceases to amaze me.  Fuckin
jungle bunny goes out there, slits
some old woman's throat for
twenty-five cents.  Fuckin nigger
gets Doris Day as a parole
officer.  But a good fella like
you gets stuck with a ball-bustin
prick.

Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair.

Vic swallows some Remy.

VIC
I just want you to know, Joe, how
much I appreciate your care
packages on the inside.

JOE
What the hell did you expect me to
do?  Just forget about you?

VIC
I just wanted you to know, they
meant a lot.

JOE
It's the least I could do Vic.  I
wish I coulda done more.
(Joe flashes a side
grin at Vic)
Vic. Toothpick Vic.  Tell me a
story?  What're your plans?

VIC
Well, what I wanna do is go back
to work.  But I got this Koons
prick deep up my ass.  He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.
My plans have always been to be
part of the team again.

There's a KNOCK at the door.

JOE
Come in.

The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie.
Vic turns around in his seat and sees him.

EDDIE
(to Vic)
I see ya sittin here, but I don't
believe it.

Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

EDDIE
How ya doin, Toothpick?

VIC
Fine, now.

EDDIE
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked
you up personally at the pen.
This whole week's just been crazy.
I've had my head up my ass the
entire time.

VIC
Funny you should mention it.
That's what your father and I been
talkin about.

EDDIE
That I should've picked you up?

VIC
No.  That your head's been up your
ass.  I walk through the door and
Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank
god.  Finally somebody who knows
what the fuck he's doing.  Vic,
Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck
up."  And I say "Well, Joe, I
coulda told you that."  "I'm
ruined!  He's ruining me!  My son,
I love him, but he's taking my
business and flushing it down the
fuckin toilet!"
(to Joe)
I'm not tellin tales out of
school.  You tell 'im Joe.
Tell 'im yourself.

JOE
Eddie, I hate like hell for you to
hear it this way.  But when Vic
asked me how's business, well, you
don't lie to a man who's just done
four years in the slammer for ya.

Eddie bobs his head up and down.

EDDIE
Oh really, is that a fact?

Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,
wrestle on the floor of Joe's office.

Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

JOE
(yelling)
Okay, okay, enough, enough!
Playtime's over!  You wanna roll
around on the floor, do it in
Eddie's office, not mine!

The two men break it up.  They are completely disheveled,
hair a mess, shirttails out.  As they get themselves
together, they continue to taunt one another.

EDDIE
Daddy, did ya see that?

JOE
What?

EDDIE
Guy got me on the ground, tried to
fuck me.

VIC
You fuckin wish.

EDDIE
You tried to fuck me in my
father's office, you sick bastard.
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home,
go do it.  But don't try to fuck
me.  I don't think of you that
way.  I mean, I like you a lot--

VIC
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I
wouldn't throw you to the crew.

EDDIE
No, you'd keep me for yourself.
Four years fuckin punks in the ass
made you appreciate prime rib when
you get it.

VIC
I might break you, Nice Guy, but
I'd make you my dog's bitch.
You'd be suckin the dick and going
down on a mangy T-bone hound.

EDDIE
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy,
walks into jail a white man, walks
out talkin like a nigger.  It's
all that black semen been shootin
up his butt.  It's backed up into
his brain and comes out of his
mouth.

JOE
Are you two finished?  We were
talkin about some serious shit
when you came in Eddie.  We got a
big problem we're tryin to solve.
Now Eddie, would you like to sit
down and help us solve it, or do
you two wanna piss fart around?

Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it.  So they both
take seats in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a
parole problem.

EDDIE
Really?  Who's your P.O.?

VIC
Craig Koons.

EDDIE
Koons?  Oh shit, I hear he's a
motherfucker.

VIC
He is a motherfucker.  He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.

EDDIE
You're coming back to work for us,
right?

VIC
I wanna.  But I gotta show this
asshole I got an honest-to-
goodness job before he'll let me
move out on my own.  I can't work
for you guys and be worried about
gettin back before ten o'clock
curfew.

JOE
(to Eddie)
We can work this out, can't we?

EDDIE
This isn't all that bad.  We can
give you a lot of legitimate jobs.
Put you on the rotation at Long
Beach as a dock worker.

VIC
I don't wanna lift crates.

EDDIE
You don't hafta lift shit.  You
don't really work there.  But as
far as the records are concerned,
you do.  I call up Matthews, the
foreman, tell him he's got a new
guy.  You're on the schedule.  You
got a timecard, it's clocked in
and out for you everyday, and you
get a pay check at the end of the
week.  And ya know dock workers
don't do too bad.  So you can move
into a halfway decent place
without Koons thinkin "what the
fuck."  And if Koons ever wants to
make a surprise visit, you're gone
that day.  That day we sent you to
Tustin.  We gotta bunch of shit
you needed to unload there.
You're at the Taft airstrip pickin
up a bunch of shit and bringing it
back.  Part of your jab is goin
different places - and we got
places all over the place.

JOE
(to Vic)
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
(to Eddie)
Vic was worried.

EDDIE
Me and you'll drive down to Long
Beach tomorrow.  I'll introduce
you to Matthews, tell him what's
going on.

VIC
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
(pause)
When do you think you'll need me
for real work?

JOE
Well, it's kinda a strange time
right now.  Things are kinda--

EDDIE
--Nuts.  We got a big meeting in
Vegas coming up.  And we're kinda
just gettin ready for that right
now.

JOE
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long
Beach.  Give ya some cash, get
that Koons fuck off your back, and
we'll be talking to ya.

EDDIE
Daddy, I got an idea.  Now just
hear it out.  I know you don't
like to use any of the boys on
these jobs, but technically, Vic
ain't one of the boys.  He's been
gone for four years.  He ain't on
no one's list.  Ya know he can
handle himself, ya know you can
trust him.

Joe looks at Vic.

Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

JOE
How would you feel about pullin a
heist with about five other guys?

VIC
What's the exposure like?

JOE
Two minutes, tops.  It's a tough
two minutes.  It's a hold up,
daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.  But you
have the fellas to deal with the
crowd.  It's a jewelry store.
They're getting a big shipment of
South African diamonds on a
certain day.  They're like a way
station.  It's gonna get picked up
the next day and sent to Hamburg.
When you walk through the door,
you'll know right where to go for
the rich stones.
The fellas are good, me and Nice
Guy picked em.  Nobody knows
anybody else.  Nobody's connected.
I don't use connected guys for
this shit.

VIC
What's the cut?

JOE
Juicy, man, real juicy.

Toothpick Vic smiles.

So does Nice Guy Eddie.

CUT TO:


INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his
portable car phone.  The sounds of the seventies are
coming out of his car radio in the form of "Love Goes
Where My Rosemary Goes" by Edison Lighthouse.

EDDIE
(into phone)
Hey Dov, we got a major situation
here.
(pause)
I know you know that.  I gotta
talk with daddy and find out what
he wants done.


FLASH ON

INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed
behind his back.  Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde
surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him.
"Love Grows .." PLAYS over the soundtrack.


BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
All I know is what Vic told me.
He said the place turned into a
fuckin bullet festival.  He took a
cop as hostage, just to get the
fuck out of there.


FLASH ON

WAREHOUSE

The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.


BACK TO EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
Do I sound like I'm jokin?  He's
fuckin driving around with the cop
in his trunk.
(pause)
I don't know who did that.  I
don't know who has the loot, if
anybody has the loot.  Who's dead,
who's alive, who's caught, who's
not...
I will know, I'm practically
there.  But what do I tell these
guys about daddy?
(pause)
You sure that's what he said?
(pause)
Okay, that's what I'll tell em.

CUT TO:


EXT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside
the warehouse.

Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse.  He gets out of
the car, looks at the other cars parked outside.

EDDIE
(to himself)
Fucking assholes.

Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open,
and steps inside the warehouse.


INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still
WAILING on him.

Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.

EDDIE
What in Sam Hill is goin on?

Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.

MR. PINK                      MR. WHITE
Hey, Nice Guy, we got a     You're askin what's goin
cop.                        on?  Where the fuck is 
Joe?

Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked
up!

MR. WHITE
No shit, he's gonna fuckin die on
us if we don't get him taken care
of.

MR. PINK
We were set up, the cops were
waiting for us.

EDDIE
What?  Nobody set anybody up.

MR. PINK
The cops were there waitin for us!

EDDIE
Bullshit.

MR. PINK
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't
there, we were.  And I'm tellin
ya, the cops had that store staked
out.

EDDIE
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?

MR. PINK
What the fuck d'you think we've
been askin each other?

EDDIE
And what are your answers?  Was it
me?  You think I set you up?

MR. PINK
I don't know, but somebody did.

EDDIE
Nobody did.  You assholes turn the
jewelry store into a wild west
show, and you wonder why cops show
up.

MR. BLONDE
Where's Joseph?

EDDIE
I ain't talked to him.  I talked
to Dov.  Dov said he's comin out
here, and he's fucking pissed.

MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
I told ya he'd be pissed.

MR. WHITE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
What are you gonna do about him?

EDDIE
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin
chance to breathe.  I got a few
questions of my own, ya know.

MR. WHITE
You ain't dying, he is.

EDDIE
I'll call somebody.

MR. WHITE
Who?

EDDIE
A snake charmer, what the fuck
d'you think.  I'll call a doctor,
take care of him, fix 'm right up.
No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue?

MR. PINK
Brown's dead, we don't know about
Blue.

EDDIE
Nobody saw what happened to Mr.
Blue?

MR. BLONDE
Well, he's either dead or he's
alive or the cops got him or they
don't.

DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.

EDDIE (OS)
I take it this is the bastard you
told me about.
(referring to the
cop)
Why the hell are you beating on
him?

MR. PINK
So he'll tell us who the fuck set
us up.

EDDIE
Would you stop it with that shit!
You beat on this prick enough,
he'll tell ya he started the
Chicago fire.  That don't
necessarily make it so.  Okay,
first things fucking last, where's
the shit?  Please tell me somebody
brought something
with them.

MR. PINK
I got a bag.  I stashed it till I
could be sure this place wasn't a
police station.

EDDIE
Well, let's go get it.  We also
gotta get rid of all those cars.
It looks like Sam's hot car lot
outside.
(pointing to Mr.
Blonde)
You stay here and babysit Orange
and the cop.
(referring to Mr.
Pink and Mr. White)
You two take a car each, I'll
follow ya.  You ditch it, I'll
pick you up, then we'll pick up
the stones.  And while I'm
following you, I'll arrange for
some sort of a doctor for our
friend.

MR. WHITE
We can't leave these guys with
him.

Meaning Mr. Blonde.

EDDIE
Why not?

Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Because this guy's a fucking
psycho.  And if you think
Joe's pissed at us, that
ain't nothing compared to how
pissed off I am at him, for puttin
me in the same room as this
bastard.

MR. BLONDE
(to Eddie)
You see what I been puttin up
with?  As soon as I walk through
the door I'm hit with this shit.
I tell 'm what you told me about
us stayin put and Mr. White whips
out his gun, sticks it in my face,
and starts screaming "You
motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you
away, blah, blah, blah."

MR. WHITE
He's the reason the place turned
into a shooting gallery.
(to Mr. Pink)
What are you, a silent partner?
Fuckin tell him.

MR. PINK
He seems all right now, but he
went crazy in the store.

MR. WHITE
This is what he was doin.

Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the
store.

MR. BLONDE
I told 'em not to touch the alarm.
They touched it.  I blew 'em full
of holes.  If they hadn't done
what I told 'em not it, they'd
still be alive.

MR. WHITE
That's your excuse for going on a
kill crazy rampage?

MR. BLONDE
I don't like alarms.

EDDIE
What does it matter who stays with
the cop?  We ain't lettin him go.
Not after he's seen everybody.
You should've never took him outta
your trunk in the first place.

MR. PINK
We were trying to find out what he
knew about the set up.

EDDIE
There is no fuckin set up!
(Eddie takes charge)
Look, this is the news.  Blondie,
you stay here and take care of
them two.  White and Pink come
with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and
sees all those fucking cars
parked out front, he's going to be
as mad at me as he is at you.

Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse
talking amongst themselves.


INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP

Mr. Blonde closes the door after them.  He then slowly
turns his head towards the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Alone at last.


C.U. COP'S FACE.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now where were we?

COP
I told you I don't know anything
about any fucking set up.  I've
only been on the force eight
months, nobody tells me anything!
I don't know anything!  You can
torture me if you want--

MR. BLONDE (OS)
--Thanks, don't mind if I do.

COP
Your boss even said there wasn't a
set up.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
First off, I don't have a boss.
Are you clear about that?

He SLAPS the cop's face.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
I asked you a question.  Are you
clear about that?

COP
Yes.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you.  I
don't really care about what you
know or don't know.  I'm gonna
torture you for awhile regardless.
Not to get information, but
because torturing a cop amuses me.
There's nothing you can say,
there's nothing you can do.
Except pray for death.

He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.


COP'S POV

Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S
"super sounds of the seventies"
weekend.

He turns on the radio.

Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS
over the speaker.

NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop.

He opens a large knife.

He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits
in it.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding
the knife, singing along with the song.

Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

A SLASH across the face.

The cop/camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing
along with the seventies hit.

Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's/our ear.

The cop/camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop/us to see.

Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out
of the way.


INT./EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT

We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...

...to his car.  He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can
of gasoline.

He walks back inside the warehouse...


INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

...carrying the can of gas.

Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's
BEGGING him not to do this.

Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

MR. BLONDE
"Clowns to the left of me,
Jokers to the right.  Here I am,
stuck in the middle with you."

He moves the match up to the cop...

...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the
bloody Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET
HITS and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody
trail behind him.

When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

MR. ORANGE
(feebly)
What's your name?

COP
Jeffrey.

MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey what?

COP
Jeffrey Andrews.

MR. ORANGE
Listen to me, Jeffrey
Andrews.  I'm a cop.

JEFFREY
I know.

MR. ORANGE
(surprised)
You do?

JEFFREY
Your name's Freddy something.

MR. ORANGE
Freddy Newendyke.

JEFFREY
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us
once, about five months ago.

MR. ORANGE
Shit.  I don't remember that at
all.

JEFFREY
I do.
(pause)
How do I look?

The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and
the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

MR. ORANGE
I don't know what to tell you
Jeffrey.

Jeffrey starts to weep.

JEFFREY
That fucking bastard!  That
fucking sick fucking bastard!

MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey, I need you to hold on.
There's officers positioned and
waiting to move in a block away.

JEFFREY
(screaming)
What the fuck are they waiting
for?  That motherfucker cut off my
ear!  He slashed my face!  I'm
deformed!

MR. ORANGE
And I'm dying.  They don't know
that.  All they know is they're
not to make a move until Joe Cabot
shows up.  I was sent undercover
to get Cabot.  You heard 'em, they
said he's on his way.  Don't pussy
out on me now, Jeffrey.  We're
just gonna sit here and bleed
until Joe
Cabot sticks his fuckin head
through that door.

INSERT: TITLE CARD  "MR. ORANGE & MR. WHITE"


INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT

A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a
Malcom X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star
on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny
bacon, cheese and avocado burger.  He sits in a booth all
alone.  He's waiting for somebody.  As he waits, he
practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his
french fries, not by mistake either--that's just how he
likes it.

We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing
a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop,
spot Holdaway, and head his way.  Holdaway sees Freddy bop
towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered
across his face.

CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.
We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Say "hello" to a motherfucker
who's inside.  Cabot's doing a job
and take a big fat guess who he
wants on the team?

HOLDAWAY
This better not be some Freddy
joke.

LOW ANGLE

looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.

FREDDY
It ain't no joke, I'm in there.
I'm up his ass.

CU ON HOLDAWAY

Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then
smiles.

HOLDAWAY
Congratulations.


EXT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT

We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
into the booth across from Holdaway.  Freddy's doing a lot
of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.


INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT

FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to
Freddy.  We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants
to meet me.  He says I should just
hang around my apartment and wait
for a phone call.  Well after
waiting three goddamn days by the
fuckin phone, he calls me last
night and says Joe's ready, and
he'll pick me up in fifteen
minutes.

The freeze frame ENDS.  Holdaway comes suddenly up to
speed and says:

HOLDAWAY
Woo all picked you up?

From here to end we cut back and forth.

FREDDY
Nice Guy.  When we got to the
bar...

HOLDAWAY
...What bar?

FREDDY
The Boots and Socks in Gardena.
When we got there, I met Joe and a
guy named Mr. White.  It's a phony
name.  My name's Mr. Orange.

HOLDAWAY
You ever seen this motherfucker
before?

FREDDY
Who, Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
No, he ain't familiar.  He ain't
one of Cabot's soldiers either.
He's gotta be from outta town.
But Joe knows him real well.

HOLDAWAY
How can you tell?

FREDDY
The way they talk to each other.
You can tell they're buddies.

HOLDAWAY
Did the two of you talk?

FREDDY
Me and Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
A little.

HOLDAWAY
What about?

FREDDY
The Brewers.

HOLDAWAY
The Milwaukee Brewers?

FREDDY
Yeah.  They had just won the night
before, and he made a killing off
'em.

HOLDAWAY
Well, if this crook's a Brewers
fan, his ass has gotta be from
Wisconsin.  And I'll bet you
everything from a diddle-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-I-know, that in
Milwaukee they got a sheet on this
Mr. White motherfucker's ass.  I
want you to go through the mugs of
guys from old Milwaukee with a
history of armed robbery, and put
a name to that face.

Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

HOLDAWAY
(with his mouth full)
What kinds questions did Cabot
ask?

FREDDY
Where I was from, who I knew, how
I knew Nice Guy, had I done time,
shit like that.

Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now.  He
motions for Freddy to elaborate.

FREDDY
He asked me if I ever done armed
robbery before.  I read him my
credits.  I robbed a few gas and
sips, sold some weed, told him
recently I held the shotgun while
me and another guy pulled down a
poker game in Portland.

CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.

HOLDAWAY (O.S.)
Didja use the commode story?

FREDDY
Fuckin-A.  I tell it real good,
too.


INT.  MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.
Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt.  Freddy
sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,
looking at pieces of paper stapled together.

FREDDY
What's this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a scene.  Memorize it.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
A undercover cop has got to be
Marlon Brando.  To do this job you
got to be a great actor.  You got
to be naturalistic.  You got to be
naturalistic as hell.  If you
ain't a great actor you're a bad
actor, and bad acting is bull shit
in this job.

FREDDY
(referring to the
papers)
But what is this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a amusing anecdote about a
drug deal.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
Something funny that happened to
you while you were doing a job.

FREDDY
I gotta memorize all this shit?

HOLDAWAY
It's like a joke.  You remember
what's important, and the rest you
make your own.  The only way to
make it your own is to keep sayin
it, and sayin it, and sayin it,
and sayin it, and sayin it.

FREDDY
I can do that.

HOLDAWAY
The things you gotta remember are
the details.  It's the details
that sell your story.  Now this
story takes place in this men's
room.  So you gotta know the
details about this men's room.
You gotta know they got a blower
instead of a towel to dry your
hands.  You gotta know the stalls
ain't got no doors.  You gotta
know whether they got liquid or
powdered soap, whether they got
hot water or not, 'cause if you do
your job when you tell your story,
everybody should believe it.  And
if you tell your story to somebody
who's actually taken a piss in
this men's room, and you get one
detail they remember right,
they'll swear by you.


INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,
rehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but
he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a
while he stumbles over his words.

FREDDY
...this was during the Los Angeles
marijuana drought of '86.  I still
had a connection.  Which was
insane, 'cause you couldn't get
weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway,
I had a connection with this
hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.
All and my friends knew it.  And
they'd give me a call and say,
"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you
think you could buy me some too?"
They knew I smoked, so they'd ask
me to buy a little for them when I
was buyin.  But it got to be
everytime I bought some weed, I
was buyin for four or five
different people.  Finally I said,
"Fuck this shit."  I'm makin this
bitch rich.  She didn't have to do
jack shit, she never even had to
meet these people.  I was fuckin
doin all the work.  So I got
together with her and told her,
"Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm
comin through for everybody, and
nobody's comin through for me.
So, either I'm gonna tell all my
friends to find their own source,
or you give me a bunch of weed,
I'll sell it to them, give you the
money, minus ten percent, and I
get my pot for free."  So, I did
if for awhile...

Freddy exits frame

CUT TO:


EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY

Another empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy
enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
previous scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a
wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to
Holdaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of
his beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he
performs his story.

FREDDY
...but then that got to be a pain
in the ass.  People called me on
the phone all the fuckin time.  I
couldn't rent a fuckin tape
without six phone calls
interrupting me.  "Hey, Freddy,
when's the next time you're gettin
some?"  "Motherfucker, I'm tryin
to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have
some, I'll let you know."  And
then these rinky-dink pot heads
come by--there's my friends and
everything, but still.  I got all
my shit laid out in sixty dollar
bags.  Well, they don't want sixty
dollars worth.  They want ten
dollars worth.  Breaking it up is
a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I
don't even know how much ten
dollars worth is.  "Well, fuck,
man, I don't want that much
around.  If I have that much
around I'll smoke it."  "Hey, if
you guys can't control your
smokin, that's not my problem.
You motherfuckers been smokin for
five years, be a adult about it."
Finally I just told my connection,
count me out.  But as it turns
out, I'm the best guy she had, and
she depended alot on my business.
But I was still sick to death of
it.  And she's trying to talk me
into not quitin.
Now this was a very weird
situation, 'cause I don't know if
you remember back in '86, there
was a major fuckin drought.
Nobody and anything.  People were
livin on resin and smokin the wood
in their pipes for months.  And
this chick had a bunch, and was
beggin me to sell it.  So I told
her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot
Man anymore.  But I would take a
little bit and sell it to my
close, close, close friends.  She
agreed to that, and said we'd keep
the same arrangement as before,
ten percent and free pot for me,
as long as I helped her out that
weekend.  She had a brick of weed
she was sellin, and she didn't
want to go to the buy alone...

CUT TO:


INT.  BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT

Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a
table in a red-lighted smokey bar.  Freddy continues his
story.  The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

FREDDY
...Her brother usually goes with
her, but he's in county
unexpectedly.

MR. WHITE
What for?

FREDDY
Traffic tickets gone to warrant.
They stopped him for something,
found the warrants on 'im, took
'im to jail.  She doesn't want to
walk around alone with all that
weed.  Well, I don't wanna do
this, I have a bad feeling about
it, but she keeps askin me, keeps
askin me, finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of listening to
it.  Well, we're picking this guy
up at the train station.

JOE
You're picking the buyer up at the
train station?  You're carrying
the weed on you?

FREDDY
Yeah, the guy needed it right
away.  Don't ask me why.  So we
get to the train station, and
we're waitin for the guy.  Now I'm
carrying the weed in one of those
carry-on bags, and I gotta take a
piss.  So I tell the connection
I'll be right back, I'm goin' to
the little boys room...

CUT TO:


INT.  MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY

MEDIUM ON FREDDY

He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his
shoulder.  Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks.  We
move into a CU.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...So I walk into the men's room,
and who's standing there?

FREEZE FRAME

on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County
Sheriffs and one German Shepherd.  All of their eyes are
on Freddy.  Everyone is frozen.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs
and a German Shepherd.

NICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)
They were waiting for you?

FREDDY (V.O.)
No.  They were just a bunch of
cops hangin out in the men's room,
talkin.  When I walked through the
door they all stopped what they
were talking about and looked at
me.


BACK TO BAR

ECU MR. WHITE

MR. WHITE
That's hard, man.  That's a fuckin
hard situation.


BACK TO MEN'S ROOM

ECU GERMAN SHEPHERD

barking his head off.

FREDDY (V.O.)
The German Shepherd starts
barkin'.  He's barkin' at me.  I
mean it's obvious he's barkin' at
me.

We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room.  We can
hear the dog barking.

FREDDY (V.O.)
Every nerve ending, all of my
senses, the blood in my veins,
everything I has was screaming,
"Take off, man, just take off, get
the fuck outta there!"  Panic hit
me like a bucket of water.  First
there was the shock of it--BAM,
right in the face!  Then I'm just
standin there drenched in panic.

SLOW MOTION

CAMERA does a PAN from face to face of the sheriffs.

FREDDY (V.O.)
And all those sheriffs are lookin
at me and they know. They can
smell it.  As sure as that fuckin
dog cam, they can smell it on me.

FREEZE FRAME

Back to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in
front of the sheriffs.  It suddenly jerks to life, and
moves to speed.  The dog is barking.  Freddy moves to his
right, out of frame.  We stay on the sheriffs.  One
sheriff yells at the dog.

SHERIFF #1
Shut up!

The dog quiets down.  Sheriff #2 continues with his story.
A couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen,
but as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.

SHERIFF #2
So my gun's drawn, right?  I got
it aimed right at him.  I tell
'em, "Freeze, don't fuckin move."
And the little idiot's lookin at
me, nodding his head "Yes," sayin
"I know...I know...I know."
Meanwhile his right hand is
creepin towards his glove box.  So
I scream at him, "Asshole, you
better fuckin freeze right now!"
And he's still lookin right at me,
saying
"I know...I know...I know."  And
his right hand's still going for
the glove box.

The CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up
against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)
I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna
shoot you in the face right now if
you don't put your hands on the
fuckin dash."  And the guy's
girlfriend, a real sexy Oriental
bitch, starts screamin at him,
"Chuck, are you out of your mind?
Put your hands on the dash like
the officer said."  And then like
nothing, the guy snaps out of it
and casually puts his hands on the
dash.

Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past
the sheriffs over to the sink.  The CAMERA PANS with him.
A sheriff is sitting on a sink.  He looks down and watches
Freddy wash his hands.

SHERIFF #1
What was he goin for?

SHERIFF #2
His registration.  Stupid fuckin
citizen, doesn't have the
slightest idea how close he came
to gettin shot.

Freddy finishes washing his hands.  He goes to dry them,
but there's only those hand drying machines.  Freddy turns
on the drying machine.  He can't hear anything the
sheriffs say now.  The sound of the machine dominates the
sound track.

These following shots are SLOW MOTION.

into the CAMERA.

We hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN.

JODIE (OS)
Lawrence "Larry" Dimick.  Also
known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin
"Al" Jacobs.  This guy is Mr. Joe-
Armed-Robbery.  He's
a pro and he makes it a habit not
to get caught.


MEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE

DOLLY slowly into C.U.

JODIE
He's only been convicted twice,
which is pretty good for somebody
living a life of crime.  Once for
armed robbery, when he was twenty-
one, in Milwaukee.


C.U. FREDDY

FREDDY
What was it?


JODIE

JODIE
Payroll office at a lumber yard.
First offense - he got eighteen
months.  He didn't get busted
again until he was thirty-two.
And then it was a backdoor bust.
A routine vice squad roust.  They
roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence
is in there knocking down a few.
He gets picked up.  He's wearing
on his person an outlaw .45
automatic, apparently his weapon
of choice.  Also, on his finger is
a diamond ring from a jewelry
store robbery a year earlier.  He
got two years back inside for
that.


TWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY

Freddy winces.

FREDDY
Goddamn, that's hard time.


JODIE

JODIE
So far, it's the only time he's
ever done.


CU HOLDAWAY

HOLDAWAY
Was this vice squad bullshit in
Milwaukee?


JODIE

JODIE
No.  The vice squad roust was in
L.A.  He's been in Los Angeles
since '77.


DOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK

from left to right.

FREDDY
When did he do this time?

JODIE
Back in '83, got out late '86.  I
found something else out I think
you two should be aware of.
About a year and a half ago, up in
Sacramento, an undercover cop,
John Dolenz, worked his way into a
bank job.  Apparently before the
job they found out he was a cop.
Now picture this:  It's Dolenz's
birthday, a bunch of cops are
waiting in his apartment for a
surprise party.  The door opens,
everyone yells "Surprise!", and
standing in the doorway is Dolenz
and this other guy sticking a gun
in Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody
knows what's going on, this
stranger shoots Dolenz dead and
starts firing two .45 automatics
into the crowd.

HOLDAWAY
What happened?

The DOLLY moves behind Jodie.

JODIE
It was a mess.  Cops got hit,
wives got hit, girlfriends got
hit, his dog got hit.  People got
glass in their faces.  Three were
killed, six were wounded.

FREDDY
They couldn't pin the killing on
one of the bank robbers?

JODIE
They tried, but they didn't have a
positive I.D. and all those guys
had alibis.  Besides, we really
didn't have anything on them.  We
had the testimony of a dead man
that they were talking
about committing a robbery.  They
never went ahead with the bank
job.

The DOLLY completes its circle.

FREDDY
And Larry Dimick was one of the
boys?

JODIE
He was probably the one.

HOLDAWAY

INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel.  Mr. Pink is

backseat together.

MR. PINK
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin
about, black women ain't the same
as white women.

MR. WHITE
(sarcastically)
There's a slight difference.

The car laughs.

MR. PINK 
Go ahead and laugh, you know what
I mean.  What a while bitch will
put up with, a black bitch won't
put up with for a minute.  They
got a line, and if you cross it,
they fuck you up.

EDDIE
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on
this.  I've seen it happen.

MR. WHITE
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such
a truism, how come every nigger I
know treats his woman like a piece
of shit?

MR. PINK
I'll make you a bet that those
same damn niggers who were showin
their ass in public, when their
bitches get 'em home, they chill
the fuck out.

MR. WHITE
Not these guys.

MR. PINK
Yeah, those guys too.

EDDIE
Let me tell you guys a story.  In
one of daddy's clubs there was
this black cocktail waitress named
Elois.

MR. WHITE
Elois?

EDDIE
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We
called her Lady E.

MR. WHITE
Where was she from, Compton?

EDDIE
No.  She was from Ladora Heights.

MR. PINK
The black Beverly Hills.  I knew
this lady from Ladora Heights
once.
(in a stuck up black
female voice)
"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
the black Beverly Hills."
EDDIE
It's not the black Beverly Hills,
it's the black Palos Verdes.
Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy
who's ever met her has jacked off
to her at least once.  You know
who she looked like?  Christie
Love.  'Member that TV show "Get
Christie Love"?  She was a black
female cop.  She always used to
say "You're under arrest, sugar."

MR. PINK
I was in the sixth grade when that
show was on.  I totally dug it.
What the fuck was the name of the
chick who played Christie
Love?

EDDIE
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier
was the other one.  Pan Grier made
the movies.  Christie Love was
like a Pam Grier TV show, without
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
What the fuck was that chick's
name?  Oh this is just great, I'm
totally fuckin tortured now.

EDDIE
Well, whoever she was, Elois
looked like her.  So one night I
walk into the club, and no Elois.
Now the bartender was a wetback,
he was a friend of mine, his name
was Carlos.
So I asked him "Hey, Carlos,
where's Lady E tonight?"  Well
apparently Lady E was married to
this real piece of dog shit.  I
mean a real animal.  And
apparently he would so things to
her.

FREDDY

Do things?  What would he do?  You
mean like beat her up?

EDDIE
Nobody knows for sure what he did.
We just know he did something.
Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
And waits for the next time this
bag of shit gets drunk.  So one
night the guy gets drunk and
passes out on the couch.  So while
the guy's
inebriated, she strips him naked.
Then she takes some crazy glue and
glues his dick to his belly.

The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

EDDIE
I'm dead fuckin serious.  She put
some on his dick and some on his
belly, then stuck 'em together.
The paramedics had to come and cut
it loose.

The car reacts badly.

MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!

FREDDY
You can do some crazy things with
it.

EDDIE
I don't know what he did to her,
but she got even.

MR. WHITE
Was he all pissed off?

MR. PINK
How would you feel if you had to
do a handstand every time you took
a piss.

The car laughs.


EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse.
The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.


INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The four men enter the building.

At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.

We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.

JOE
(to everybody)
...So they're talkin about how
they get their wives off, and the
French guys says:
(in a bad French
accent)
"All I gotta do is take my pinky
and tickle my Fifi's little oo la
la  and she rises a foot off the
bed."

Back to Joe.

So the dago says:


CU ON JOE

JOE
(in a good Brooklyn
accent)
"That's nothin.  When I take the
tip of my tongue and wiggle it
against my Mary Louise's little
fun pimple, she rises two feet off
da bed."  Then our friend from
Poland says:
(in dumb voice)
"You guys ain't no cocksmen. When
I get through fuckin my Sophie, I
wipe my dick on the curtains and
you know what?  She hits the
roof!"

Joe laughs like a crazy man.

JOE
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.

JOE
Ain't that a masterpiece?  Stupid
fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on
the drapes.

Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.

JOE
You're here, great!

Joe EXITS C.U.

We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House
scene together again.  Some sit on folding chairs, some
stand.  Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.
A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to
the right.

We do a 360 around the men.

EDDIE
We woulda gotten here sooner, but
we got backed up around La Brea
and Pico.

JOE
No hurry.
(to the boys)
All right, let's get to know one
another.  With the exception of
Eddie and myself, who you already
know, you'll be using aliases.
Under no circumstances are you to
tell one another your real name or
anything else about yourself.
That includes where you're from,
your wife's name, where you
might've done time, about a bank
in St. Petersburg you might've
robbed.  You guys don't say shit
about who you are, where you been
or what you've done.  Only thing
you guys can talk about is what
you're going to do.  This way the
only ones who know who the members
of the team are are Eddie and
myself.  And that's the way I like
it.  Because in the unlikely event
of one of you getting apprehended
by the cops, not that I expect
that to happen - it most
definitely should not happen - it
hasn't happened, you don't have
anything to deal with.  You don't
know any names.  You know my name,
you know Eddie's name.  That I
don't care about.  You gotta prove
it.  I ain't worried.  Besides,
this way you gotta trust me.  I
like that.  I set this up and
picked the men I wanted for it.
None of you came to me, I
approached all of you.  I know
you.  I know your work, I know
your reputation.  I know you as
men.  Except for this guy.

Joe points a finger at Freddy.

Freddy shits a brick.

JOE
But he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he
wouldn't be here.  Okay, let me
introduce everybody to everybody.
But once again, at the risk of
being redundant, if I even think I
hear somebody telling or referring
to somebody by their Christian
name...
(Joe searches for the
right words)
...you won't want to be you.
Okay, quickly.
(pointing at the men
as he gives them a
name)
Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,
Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.
Pink.

MR. PINK
Why am I Mr. Pink?

JOE
Cause you're a faggot.

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Why can't we pick out our own
colors?

JOE
I tried that once, it don't work.
You get four guys fighting over
who's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since
nobody knows anybody else, nobody
wants to back down.  So forget it,
I pick.  Be thankful you're not
Mr. Yellow.

MR. BROWN
Yeah, but Mr. Brown?  That's too
close to Mr. Shit.

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.
Pussy.  Tell you what, let me be
Mr. Purple.  That sounds good to
me, I'm Mr. Purple.

JOE
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody
from another job's Mr. Purple.
You're Mr. Pink.

MR. WHITE
Who cares what your name is?  Who
cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.
Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...

MR. PINK
Oh that's really easy for you to
say, you're Mr. White.  You gotta
cool-sounding name.  So tell me,
Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink"
is no big deal, you wanna trade?

JOE
Nobody's trading with anybody!
Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin
city counsel meeting!  Listen up
Mr. Pink.  We got two ways here,
my way or the highway.  And you
can go down either of 'em.  So
what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

MR. PINK
Jesus Christ, Joe.  Fuckin forget
it.  This is beneath me.  I'm Mr.
Pink, let's move on.

CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard
with the layout of the jewelry store on it.

JOE (OS)
Okay fellas, let's get into this.

CUT TO:


EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY

Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty
little league baseball field.

HOLDAWAY
Okay, we're gonna station men
across the street from Karina's
Fine Jewelry.  But their orders
will be not to move in unless the
robbery gets out of control.  You
gotta make sure they don't have to
move in.  You're inside to make
sure that everything goes
according to Hoyle.  We have men
set up a block away from the
warehouse rendezvous.  They got
complete visibility of the
exterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot
shows up, we'll see it.

FREDDY
What's your visibility of the
interior?

HOLDAWAY
We can't see shit on the inside.
And we can't risk gettin any
closer for fear they'll spot us.

FREDDY
This is bullshit, Jim.  I get all
the fuckin danger of having you
guys in my back pocket but none of
the safety.

HOLDAWAY
What's the matter, Newendyke?  Job
too tough for ya?  No one lied to
you.  You always knew we'd hang
back until Joe Cabot showed up.

FREDDY
Oh this is great.  You ain't
giving me no fuckin protection
whatsoever.  But you are giving me
an attitude.

HOLDAWAY
Since when does an undercover cop
have protection?  Freddy, you came
into this thing with your eyes
wide open, so don't start screamin
blind man now.  I understand
you're nervous.  I wish the
warehouse had more visible
windows, but it doesn't.  We have
to make do with the cards we're
dealt.

FREDDY
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
I'm just remarking on how shitty
the situation is!

HOLDAWAY
I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
but I've found tough love works
best in these situations.  We have
to get Joe Cabot in the company of
the thieves and in the same
vicinity as the loot.
We don't care about these other
bastards.  We're willing to offer
them good deals to testify against
Cabot.

FREDDY
Isn't this risk unorthodox?

HOLDAWAY
What?

FREDDY
Letting them go ahead with the
robbery?

HOLDAWAY
The whole idea behind this
operation is to catch Joe Cabot
red-handed.  We bust these hired
hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
Letting them go through with the
heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
are very clean.  We got people
surrounding the perimeter.  We got
a guy and a gal on the inside
posing as a couple shopping for
rings.  We could replace the
employees with cops, but we'd run
the risk of tipping 'em off.

FREDDY
That's out.  They know the faces
of who works what shift.

HOLDAWAY
These guys are professionals.
We're professionals.  It's a risk,
but I think it's a calculated
risk.


EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY

We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.

CUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on
customers through the windows.

While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.
White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Let's go over it.  Where are you?

FREDDY (VO)
I stand outside and guard the
door.  I don't let anybody come in
or go out.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Brown?

FREDDY (VO)
Mr. Brown stays in the car.  He's
parked across the street till I
give him the signal, then he pulls
up in front of the store.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

FREDDY (VO)
Crowd control.  They handle
customers and employees in the
display area.


INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
from the jewelry store, staking it out.

MR. WHITE
Myself and Mr. Pink?

FREDDY
You two take the manager in the
back and make him give you the
diamonds.  We're there for those
stones, period.  Since no display
cases are being fucked with, no
alarms should go off.  We're out
of there in two minutes, not one
second longer.  What if the
manager won't give up the
diamonds?

MR. WHITE
When you're dealing with a store
like this, they're insured up the
ass.  They're not supposed to give
you and resistance
whatsoever.  If you get a customer
or an employee who thinks he's
Charles Bronson, take the butt of
your gun and smash their nose in.
Drops 'em right to the floor.
Everyone jumps, he falls down,
screaming, blood squirts out his
nose.  Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin shit after
that.  You might get some bitch
talk shit to ya.  But give her a
look, like you're gonna smash her
in the face next.  Watch her shut
the fuck up.  Now if it's a
manager, that's a different story.
The managers know better than to
fuck around.  So if one's givin
you static, he probably thinks
he's a real cowboy.  So what you
gotta do is break that son-of-a-
bitch in two.  If you wanna know
something and he won't tell you,
cut off one of his fingers.  The
little one.  Then you tell 'im his
thumb's next.  After that he'll
tell ya if he wears ladies
underwear.  I'm hungry, let's get
a taco.

CUT TO:


EXT. ALLEY - DAY

It's the moment of the robbery.  The alley is empty.

In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.  Guns
FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,
glass BREAKING...

A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

Freddy opens the driver's side door.  A bloody SCREAMING
Mr. Brown FALLS out.

MR. BROWN
(screaming)
My eyes!  My eyes!  I'm blind, I'm
fucking blind!

FREDDY
You're not blind, there's just
blood in your eyes.

Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.  He RUNS to the
end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the
patrol car.

Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.
White's ambush in shock.

Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

MR. BROWN
Mr. Orange?  You're Mr. Orange,
aren't you?

By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown
is dead.

Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

MR. WHITE
Is he dead?

Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

MR. WHITE
Did he did or not?

Freddy, scared.

FREDDY
I'm sorry.

MR. WHITE
What?  Snap out of it!

Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as
he RUNS.

They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.  He points
his jun at her.

MR. WHITE
Get us outta here!

Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

Freddy starts to climb in.

The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

MR. WHITE
The bitch's got a gun!

She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
face.


C.U. ON FREDDY

as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened
to him and what he's done.  SLOW MOTION.

Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car.  He
SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.


INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is
CRYING.

We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the
getaway car.  Except this time, we never leave Freddy.

MR. WHITE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.

FREDDY
I'm sorry.  I can't believe she
killed me...


CUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:


INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Mr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the
passenger seat going through the satchel with the
diamonds.  Mr. White is in the backseat.  The car is
SPEEDING back to the garage.

EDDIE
(looking through the
case)
You know, all things considered,
this was pretty successful.

MR. WHITE
I don't believe you just said
that.

EDDIE
No, it was messy as hell, but do
you realize how much you got away
with?  There's over two million
dollars worth of diamonds here.

MR. PINK
I love this guy.

EDDIE
Hey, what's done is done.  We can
all sit around and have a big cry
about it or we can deal with the
situation at hand.

MR. WHITE
The situation as hand isn't that
fuckin satchel.  You and Joe have
a responsibility to your men.

EDDIE
Hey, it's the best I could do.

MR. WHITE
The man is fucking dying.

EDDIE
And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll
take care of him.

MR. WHITE
He needs a doctor, not a fuckin
nurse.

EDDIE
Ask me how many doctors I called.
You wanna embarrass yourself, ask
me how many doctors I called.

MR. WHITE
Obviously not enough.

EDDIE
Fuck you! You gotta little black
book, then whip is out.  If not,
listen how it is.  I called three
doctors and couldn't get through
to shit.  Now, time being a
factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet
broad, helluva broad, and a
registered nurse.  Told her a
bullshit story, upside:  she said
bring him to her apartment.

MR. WHITE
If he dies I'm holding you
personally responsible.

EDDIE
Fuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you
wanna play that way.  I am
personally leaving myself
vulnerable with this Bonnie
situation.  I don't think she'll
call the cops, but I don't know
for sure.  But me being too nice-
a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk
it.  But no fuckin more.
(he grabs his
portable phone)
I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin
her to forget it.  You take care
of your friend, you know so much
about it.

MR. PINK
Goddamnit, will you guys grow up!

EDDIE
I don't need to grow up, my
friend.  I am a grown up.  I'm
being responsible, I'm taking care
of business.

MR. WHITE
Cut the shit!  I don't think you
called anybody except some cooze
you once fucked, who happens to
wear orthopedic shoes.  And I
don't think that's good enough
care for a gut-shot man.

EDDIE
Yeah, well I don't give a flying
fuck what you think!

MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
Look, he's not sayin this bitch is
gonna operate on him.  She's gonna
give him better attention than we
can until we can get a doctor.
Nobody's forgotten about doctors.
Joe'll get one in a snap.  This is
something we're doing in the
meantime.  I think both of you are
actin like a couple of assholes.

EDDIE
Yeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I
leave myself wide open, and I'm an
asshole.


INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

MEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and
Mr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks.

We see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,
shot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a
bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding
his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the
shot.

EDDIE
What the fuck happened here?

Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Orange)
What happened?

MR. ORANGE
(very weakly)
Blonde went crazy.  He slashed the
cop's face, cut off his ear and
was gonna burn him alive.

EDDIE
(yelling)
Who cares what he was gonna do to
this fuckin pig?

Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and
the chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him
once more.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
You were saying he went crazy?
Something like that?  Worse or
better?

MR. ORANGE
Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.
He was gonna kill the cop and me.
And when you guys walked through
the door, he was gonna blow you to
hell and make off with the
diamonds.

MR. WHITE
(to Eddie)
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?
That sick piece of shit was a
stone cold psycho.

MR. ORANGE
(to Eddie)
You could've asked the cop, if you
didn't just kill him.  He talked
about what he was going to do when
he was slicing him up.

EDDIE
I don't buy it.  It doesn't make
sense.

MR. WHITE
It makes perfect fuckin sense to
me.  Eddie, you didn't see how he
acted during the job, we did.

Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

MR. PINK
He's right about the ear, it's
hacked off.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
Let me say this out loud, just to
get it straight in my mind.
According to you, Mr. Blonde was
gonna kill you.  Then when we came
back, kill us, grab the diamonds,
and scram.  That's your story?
I'm correct about that, right?

MR. ORANGE
Eddie, you can believe me or not
believe me, but it's the truth.  I
swear on my mother's eternal soul
that's what happened.

The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.

There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange
has said.  Finally:

EDDIE
You're a fuckin liar.  Now why
don't you drop the fuckin fairy
tale and tell me what really
happened?

MR. WHITE (OS)
He told you what really happened.
You just can't deal with it.

MR. ORANGE (OS)
Okay, you're right, I'm lying.
Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm
not above pullin a fast one.  Get
rid of Blonde, we share his split
- no, scratch that, I shot him
'cause I didn't like his hair
style.  I didn't like his shoes
either.  If it has just been his
hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,
let him live.  But hair and
footwear together, he's a goner.

EDDIE
The man you killed was just
released from prison.  He got
caught at a company warehouse full
of hot items.  He could've walked
away.  All he had to do was say my
dad's name.  But instead he shut
his mouth and did his time.  He
did four years for us, and he did
'em like a man.  And we were very
grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're
tellin me this very good friend of
mine, who did four years for my
father, who in four years never
made a deal, no matter what they
dangled in front of him, you're
telling me that now, that now this
man is free, and we're making good
on our commitment to him, he's
just gonna decide, right out of
the fuckin blue, to rip us off?

Silence.

EDDIE
Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
what really happened?

VOICE (OS)
Why?  It'll just be more bullshit.

Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing
in the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room.

JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
This man set us up.

CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

EDDIE
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know
what's happening.

JOE
That's okay, Eddie, I do.

MR. WHITE
(to Joe)
What the fuck are you talking
about?

JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
That piece of shit.  Workin with
the cops.

MR. WHITE   MR. PINK   EDDIE
What?

JOE
I said this lump of shit is workin
with the LAPD.


MR. ORANGE'S POV

Looking up from the floor at everybody.

Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

JOE
Aren't you?

MR. ORANGE (OS)
I don't have the slightest fuckin
idea what you're talkin about.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly to Joe)
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

JOE
Like hell I am.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly)
Joe, trust me on this, you've made
a mistake.  He's a good kid. I
understand you're hot, you're
super-fuckin pissed.  We're all
real emotional.  But you're
barking up the wrong tree.  I know
this man, and he wouldn't do that.

JOE
You don't know jack shit.  I do.
This rotten bastard tipped off the
cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue killed.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blue's dead?

JOE
Dead as Dillinger.

EDDIE
The motherfucker killed Vic.

MR. WHITE
How do you know all this?

JOE
He was the only one I wasn't a
hundred percent on.  I should have
my fucking head examined for goin
forward when I wasn't a hundred
percent.  But he seemed like a
good kid, and I was impatient and
greedy and all the things that
fuck you up.

MR. WHITE
(screaming)
That's your proof?

JOE
You don't need proof when you got
instinct.  I ignored it before,
but not no more.

He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of
firearms.

Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

EDDIE
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Put your gun down!

Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.

MR. WHITE
Joe, you're making a terrible
mistake I can't let you make.

EDDIE
Stop pointing your fuckin gun at
daddy!

Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

JOE
Don't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry
have been friends a long time, he
ain't gonna shoot.  We like each
other too much.

MR. WHITE
Joe, if you kill that man, you die
next.  Repeat, if you kill that
man, you die next!

We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.


MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY

Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off
him.

Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to
start firing any minute.

Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.
White.

Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

Nobody says nothing.


FOUR SHOT

of guys ready for violence.  Mr. Pink in the B.G.

MR. PINK
C'mon, guys, nobody wants this.
We're supposed to me fuckin
professionals!

Joe raises his head to Mr. White.

JOE
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

MR. WHITE
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
this!

JOE
Larry, I'm askin you to trust me
on this.

MR. WHITE
Don't ask me that.

JOE
I'm not askin, I'm betting.

Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Daddy, don't!

Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.

Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face.  Joe brings his
hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
chest.

Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

Joe's dead.

Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest
heaving.  The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,
not moving.

Mr. Pink is standing motionless.  Finally he grabs the
satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

We hear outside a CAR START.  Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN
yells out:

POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze! Get out of the car and lie
face down on the ground!

MR. PINK (OS)
Don't shoot!

We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,
MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.

While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
but FALLS DOWN.  He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange
lies.

He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
stroking his brow.

MR. WHITE
(with much effort)
Sorry, kid.  Looks like we're
gonna do a little time.

Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an
effort:

MR. ORANGE
I'm a cop.

Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
brow.

MR. ORANGE
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
Orange's eyes.

The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.

The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside.  We don't see
anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze, motherfucker!  Drop your
fucking gun!

Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

BANG

We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.

THE END

FADE IN:

EXT. CADILLAC BAR - TWILIGHT
Gotham city rises up in the b.g.

INT. BAR - NIGHT
A smoky cocktail bar in downtown Detroit.
CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster, hepcat, is trying to
pick up on an older lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered
by him, in fact, she's a little charmed. But, you can
tell that she isn't going to leave her barstool.

CLARENCE
In Jailhouse Rock, he's everything
rockabilly's about. I mean, he is
rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty,
rude. In that movie he couldn't
give a fuck about anything except
rockin' and rollin', livin' fast,
dyin' young, and leaving a good
lookin' corpse.
I love that scene where after
he's made it big he's throwing
a big cocktail party, and all
these highborws are there, and
he's singing, 'Baby You're So
Square... Baby, I Don't Care.'
Now, they got him dressed like a
dick. He's wearing these stupid
lookin' pants, this horrible
sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater
boy. I even think they got him
wearin' penny loafers. Despite
all that shit, all the highbrows
at the party, big house, stupid
clothes, he's still a rude lookin'
motherfucker. I'd watch that
hillbilly and I'd want to be him
so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm
no fag, but Elvis was good
lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier
than most women. I always said
if I ever had to fuck a guy...
I mean had to cuz my life depended
on it... I'd fuck Elvis.
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.

LUCY
I'd fuck Elvis.

CLARENCE
Really?

LUCY
When he was alive. I wouldn't
fuck him now.

CLARENCE
I don't blame you.
(they laugh)
So, we'd both fuck Elvis. It's
nice to meet people with common
interests, isn't it?
Lucy laughs.

CLARENCE
Well, enough about the king, how
'bout you?

LUCY
How 'bout me what?

CLARENCE
How 'bout you go to the movies
with me tonight?

LUCY
What are we gonna go see?

CLARENCE
A Sonny Chiba triple feature.
The Streetfighter, Return of the
Streetfighter, and Sister
Streetfighter.

LUCY
Who's Sonny Chiba?

CLARENCE
He is, bar none, the greatest
actor working in martial arts
movies ever.

LUCY
(not believing this)
You wanna take me to a Kung Fu
movie?

CLARENCE
(holding up three
fingers)
Three Kung Fu movies.
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.

LUCY
(laughing)
I don't think so. Not my cup of
tea.

INT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM - DAY

TITLE CARD: "MOTORCITY"
The SOUNDS of the CITY flow in through an open window:
CAR HORNS, GUN SHOTS and VOICES. Paint is peeling off
the walls and the once green carpet is stained black.
On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with
clear plastic bags of cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have
been dropped carelessly around the suitcase. On the far
end of the room, against the wall, is a TV, "Bewitched"
is playing.
On the opposite end of the room, by the front door, is a
table. DREXL SPIVEY and FLOYD DIXON sit around it.
Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic bags and
a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, but you
wouldn't know it to listen to him.

DREXL
Nigger, get outta my face with
that bullshit.

FLOYD
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that
shit.

DREXL
That's bullshit.
BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older
than Drexl and Floyd, walks through the door carrying
hamburgers and french fries in two greasy brown paper
bags.

FLOYD
Naw man, that's some serious shit.

DREXL
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.

BIG D
What the fuck are you talkin'
about?

DREXL
Floyd say he don't be eatin'
pussy.

BIG D
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat
pussy is lyin' his ass off.

DREXL
I heard that.

FLOYD
Hold on a second, Big D. You
sayin' you eat pussy?

BIG D
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat
the pussy. I eat the butt. I eat
every motherfuckin' thang.

DREXL
Preach on, Big D.

FLOYD
Looky here. If I ever did eat
some pussy -- I would never eat
any pussy -- but, if I did eat
some pussy, I sure as hell
wouldn't tell no goddamn body.
I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.

BIG D
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough
sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot
a crazy ass things.
So you won't eat pussy?
Motherfucker, you'll be up there
suckin' niggers' dicks.

DREXL
Heard that.
Drexl and Big D bump fists.

FLOYD
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's
so funny, oh it's so funny.
(he takes a hit off
of a joint)
There used to be a time when
sisters didn't know shit about
gettin' their pussy licked. Then
the sixties came an' they started
fuckin' around with white boys.
And white boys are freaks for that
shit --

DREXL
-- Because it's good!

FLOYD
Then after a while sisters get
used to gettin' their little pussy
eat. And because you white boys
had to make pigs of yourselves,
you fucked it up for every nigger
in the world everywhere.

BIG D
(solemly)
Drexl. On behalf of me and all
the brothers who aren't here. I'd
like to express our gratitude --
Drexl and Big D bust up.

FLOYD
Go on, pussy eaters... laugh. You
look like you be eatin' pussy.
You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if
a nigger wants to get his dick
sucked he's got to do a bunch of
fucked up shit.

BIG D
So you do eat pussy!

FLOYD
Naw, naw!

BIG D
You don't like it but you eat that
shit.
(to Drexl)
He eats it.

DREXL
Damn skippy. He like it too.

BIG D
(mock English accent)
Me thinketh he doth protest too
much.

FLOYD
Well fuck you guys then! You guys
are fucked up!

DREXL
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin'
with ya. But I wanna ask a
question. You with some fine
bitch, I mean a brick shithouse
bitch -- You're with Jayne
Kennedy. You're with Jayne
Kennedy and you say; 'Bitch, suck
my dick!' And then Jayne Kennedy
says; 'First things first, nigger,
I ain't suckin' shit till you
bring your ass over here an' lick
my bush!' Now, what do you say?

FLOYD
I tell Jayne Kennedy 'suck my dick
or I'll beat your ass!'

BIG D
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne
Kennedy she'll have you ass in
Wayne County so fast --

DREXL
Nigger back off, you ain't beatin'
shit. Now what would you do?

FLOYD
I'd say fuck it!
Drexl and Big D get up from the table, disgusted and walk
away leaving Floyd sitting all alone.
Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching
"Bewitched."

FLOYD
(yelling after them)
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!

BIG D
(not even looking)
Take that shit somewhere else.

DREXL
(marching back)
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?

FLOYD
If it came down to who eats who,
damn Skippy.

DREXL
With that terrible mug of yours if
Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her
pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet,
chow on her shit, and suck her dogs
dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.

BIG D
(glued to TV)
I'm hip.

DREXL
In fact, I'm gonna show you what
I mean with a little demonstration.
Big D, toss me that shotgun.
Without turning away from "Bewitched" he picks up the
shotgun and tosses it to Drexl.

DREXL
(to Floyd)
Allright, check this out.
(referring to shotgun)
Now, pretend this is Jayne
Kennedy. And you're you.
Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and
BLOWS him away.
Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.
Drexl, waiting for him FIRES from across the room.
The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder,
spinning him around.
Drexl makes a bee-line toward his victim and FIRES again.
Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams
into the wall and drops.
Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves.
As he gets to the front door he surveys the carnage,
spits, and walks out.

CUT TO:

INT. LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT
Sonny Chiba, as "Streetfighter" Terry Surki, dives into a
group of guys, fists and feet flying and whips ass on the
silver screen.
Clarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of
him, nibbling on popcorn, eyes big as saucers, and a big
smile on his face.

EXT. LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT
A cab pulls up to the outside of the Lyric. The marquee
carries the names of the triple feature: The Street-
fighter, Return of the Streetfighter, and Sister
Streetfighter. ALABAMA steps out of the taxi cab and
walks up to the box office.
A BOX OFFICE GIRL reading an Iron Man comic looks at her.

ALABAMA
One, please.

BOX OFFICE GIRL
Ninety-nine cents.

ALABAMA
Which one is on now?

BOX OFFICE GIRL
Return of the Streetfighter. It's
been on about forty-five minutes.

INT. LYRIC THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT
Alabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the con-
cession stand. A young Usher takes care of her.

ALABAMA
Can I have a medium popcorn? A
super large Mr. Pibb, and a box
of Goobers.

INT. LYRIC THEATER
It's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny
Chiba taking on all comers.
Alabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food.
She makes a quick scan of the theater. Not many people
are there. She makes a bee-line for the front which just
so happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks
the row of seats just behind Clarence and starts making
her way down it.
Clarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone
moving towards him. He turns his attention back to the
screen, trying not to be so obvious.
When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks
a discarded wine bottle, causing her to trip and spill
her popcorn all over Clarence.

ALABAMA
Oh, look what happened. Oh God,
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

CLARENCE
Yeah, I'm fine. It didn't hurt.

ALABAMA
I'm the clumsiest person in the
world.

CLARENCE
(picking popcorn out
of his hair)
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Accidents happen.

ALABAMA
(picking popcorn out
of his hair)
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks
for being such a sweetheart. You
could have been a real dick.
Alabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.
Clarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't
easy, and get back into the movie.
They both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama
leans forward and taps Clarence on the shoulder.

ALABAMA
Excuse me. I hate to bother you
again. Would you mind too terribly
on filling me in on what I missed?
Jumping at this opportunity.

CLARENCE
Not at all. Okay, this guy here,
he's Sonny Chiba.

ALABAMA
The Oriental.

CLARENCE
The Oriental in black. He's an
assassin.
Now, at the beginning he was hired
to kill this guy the cops had. So
he got himself arrested. They take
him into the police station. And
he starts kickin' all the cops asses.
Now, while keeping them at bay, he
finds the guy he was supposed to kill.
Does a number on him. Kicks the cops'
asses some more. Kicks the bars out
of the window. And jumps out into a
get away car that was waiting for him.

ALABAMA
Want some Goobers?

CLARENCE
Thanks a lot.

ALABAMA
I thought Sonny was the good guy.

CLARENCE
He ain't so much a good guy as he is
just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't
be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up
for life. Hold on, a fight scene's
comin' up.
They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks ass.

TIME CUT:

THEATER - LATER
On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies
lay all around him. "THE END" (in Japanese) flashes on
the screen.
The theater lights go up. Alabama's now sitting in the
seat next to Clarence. They're both applauding.

ALABAMA
Great movie. Action packed!

CLARENCE
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny
kick ass?

ALABAMA
Sonny kicks ass.

CLARENCE
You shouldda saw the first original
uncut version of The Streetfigher.
It was the only movie up to that
time rated X for violence. But we
just saw the R.

ALABAMA
If that was the R, I'd love to
see the X.

CLARENCE
My name is Clarence, and what
is yours?

ALABAMA
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to
meet ya.

CLARENCE
Is that your real name? Really?

ALABAMA
That's my real name, really. I
got proof. See.
She shows Clarence her driver's license.

CLARENCE
Well, cut my legs off and call me
shorty. There's a pretty original
moniker there, Alabama. Sounds like
a Pam Grier movie.
(announcer voice)
She's a sixteen calibre kitten,
equally equiped for killin' an
lovin'. She carried a sawed-off
shotgun in her purse, a black belt
around her waist, and the white
hot fire of hate in her eyes. Pam
Grier is Alabama Whitman. Pray
for Forgiveness. Rated R... for
Ruthless Revenge.

EXT. LYRIC THEATRE
Clarence and Alabama are outside the theatre. With the
marquee lit up in the b.g. they both perform unskilled
martial arts moves. Clarence and Alabama break up
laughing.

CLARENCE
Where's your car? I'll walk you
to it.

ALABAMA
I took a cab.

CLARENCE
You took a cab to see three Kung
Fu movies?

ALABAMA
Sure. Why not?

CLARENCE
Nothing. It's just you're a girl
after my own heart.

ALABAMA
What time is it?

CLARENCE
'Bout twelve.

ALABAMA
I suppose you gotta get up
early, huh?

CLARENCE
No. Not particularly.
(pause)
How come?

ALABAMA
Well, it's just when I see a really
good movie I really like to go out
and get some pie, and talk about it.
It's sort of a tradition. Do you
like to eat pie after you've seen
a good movie?

CLARENCE
I love to get pie after a movie.

ALABAMA
Would you like to get some pie?

CLARENCE
I'd love some pie.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all
night Denny's. It's about 12:30 AM. Clarence is having
a piece of chocolate cream pie and a Coke. Alabama's
nibbling on a piece of heated apple pie and sipping a
large Tab.

CLARENCE
Well, enough about the king.
How about you?

ALABAMA
How 'bout me what?

CLARENCE
Tell me about yourself.

ALABAMA
There's nothing to tell.

CLARENCE
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be?
The phantom lady?

ALABAMA
What do you want to know?

CLARENCE
Well, for starters, what do you do?
Where're ya from? What's your
favorite color? Who's your favorite
movie star? What kinda music do you
like? What are your turn-ons and
turn-offs? Do you have a fella?
What's the story behind you takin'
a cab to the most dangerous part
of town alone? And, in a theatre
full of empty seats, why did you
sit by me?
Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and
looks at Clarence.

ALABAMA
Ask me them again. One by one.

CLARENCE
What do you do?

ALABAMA
I don't remember.

CLARENCE
Where are you from?

ALABAMA
I might be from Tallahassee. But
I'm not sure yet.

CLARENCE
What's you favorite color?

ALABAMA
I don't remember. But off the top
of my head, I'd say black.

CLARENCE
Who's you favorite movie star?

ALABAMA
Burt Reynolds.

CLARENCE
Would you like a bite of my pie?

ALABAMA
Yes, I would.
Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites
it off.

CLARENCE
Like it?

ALABAMA
Very much. Now, where were we?

CLARENCE
What kinda music do you like?

ALABAMA
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff.
You know, like 'He's a Rebel.'

CLARENCE
What are your turn-ons?

ALABAMA
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can
appreciate the finer things in life,
like Elvis' voice, good Kung Fu,
and a tasty piece of pie.

CLARENCE
Turn-offs?

ALABAMA
I'm sure there must be something,
but I don't really remember. The
only thing that comes to mind are
Persians.

CLARENCE
Do you have a fellah?
She looks at Clarence and smiles.

ALABAMA
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again
later.

CLARENCE
What's the story behind you takin'
a cab to the most dangerous part
of town alone?

ALABAMA
Apparently, I was hit on the head
with something really heavy, giving
me a form of amnesia. When I came
to, I didn't know who I was, where
I was, or where I came from.
Luckily, I had my driver's license
or I wouldn't even know my name.
I hoped it would tell me where I
lived, but it had a Tallahassee
address on it, and I stopped someone
on the street and they told me I was
in Detroit. So that was no help.
But I did have some money on me, so
I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin'
that looked familiar. For some reason,
and don't ask me why, that theater
looked familiar. So I told him to
stop and I got out.

CLARENCE
And in a theater full of empty
seats, why did you sit by me?

ALABAMA
Because you looked like a nice
guy, and I was a little scared.
And I sure couldda used a nice
guy about that time, so I spilled
my popcorn on you.
Clarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and
sucks on the straw until it makes that slurping sound. He
puts it aside and stares into her soul.
A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.

ALABAMA
Aren't you just dazzled by my
imagination, lover boy?
(eats her last piece
of pie)
Where to next?

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT
It's about 1:30 AM. Clarence has taken Alabama to where
he works. It's a comic book store called "Heros For Sale."
Alabama thinks this place is super cool.

ALABAMA
Wow. Whatta swell place to work.

CLARENCE
Yeah, I got the key, so I come
here at night, hang out, read
comic books, play music.

ALABAMA
How long have you worked here?

CLARENCE
Almost four years.

ALABAMA
That's a long time.

CLARENCE
I'm hip. But you know, I'm
comfortable here. It's easy work.
I know what I'm doing. Everybody
who works here is my buddy. I'm
friendly with most of the customers.
I just hang around and talk about
comic books all day.

ALABAMA
Do you get paid a lot?

CLARENCE
That's where the trouble comes
into paradise. But the boss lets
you borrow money if you need it.
Wanna see what Spiderman number
one looks like?

ALABAMA
You bet. How much is that worth?
Clarence gets a box off the shelf.

CLARENCE
Four hundred bucks.

ALABAMA
I didn't even know they had stores
that just sold comic books.

CLARENCE
Well, we see other things too.
Cool stuff. Man From U.N.C.L.E.
lunch boxes. Green Hornet board
games. Shit like that. But
comic books are our main business.
There's a lot of collectors around
here.
She holds up a little G.I. Joe-size action figure of a
black policeman.

ALABAMA
What's this?

CLARENCE
That's a Rookies doll. George
Stanford Brown. We gotta lotta
dolls. They're real cool.
Did you know they came out with
dolls for all the actors in
The Black Hole? I always found it
funny that somewhere there's a kid
playin' with a little figure of
Ernest Borgnine.
He pulls out a plastic-encased Spiderman comic from
the box.

CLARENCE
Spiderman, number one. The one
that started it all.
Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama.

ALABAMA
God, Spiderman looks different.

CLARENCE
He was just born, remember? This
is the first one. You know that
guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that
the story of Spiderman is the
story of Christ, just disguised.
Well, I thought about that even
before I heard him say it. Hold
on, let me show you my favorite
comic book cover of all time.
(pulls out another comic)
Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandoes.
One of the coolest series known to
man. They're completely worthless.
You can get number one for about
four bucks. But that's one of
the cool things about them, they're
so cheap.
(opens one up)
Just look at that artwork, will ya.
Great stories. Great characters.
Look at this one.
We see the Sgt. Fury panels.

CLARENCE
Nick's gotten a ring for his
sweetheart and he wears it around
his neck on a chain. Okay, later
in the story he gets into a fight
with a Nazi bastard on a ship. He
knocks the guy overboard, but the
kraut grabs a hold of his chain and
the ring goes overboard too. So,
Nick dives into the ocean to get
it. Isn't that cool?
She's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and
meets her gaze.

CLARENCE
Alabama, I'd like you to have this.
Clarence hands her the Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commadoes
comic book, he loves so much.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
Clarence and Alabama make love in his bed. However,
while they're not missing a beat during intercourse,
Clarence can't shut up. The following dialogue sounds
exactly like what it is, a man and woman in the throes
of passion trying to carry on a conversation.

CLARENCE
You know when you sat behind me?

ALABAMA
At the movies?

CLARENCE
Uh-huh. I was tryin' to think of
somethin' to say to you, then I
thought 'She doesn't want me
bothering her.'

ALABAMA
What would make you think that?

CLARENCE
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.

ALABAMA
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
Their lips envelop each other.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie
posters, pictures of Elvis, anything you can imagine.
The sweaty lovebirds are soaking in a post-passion hot
bath. By the look of the comfort they share, it would
be hard to imagine that they met not five hours ago.

ALABAMA
I love Janis.

CLARENCE
You know a lot of people have
misconceptions of how she died.

ALABAMA
She OD'd, didn't she?

CLARENCE
Yeah, she OD'd. But she wasn't on
her last legs or anything. She
didn't take too much. It shouldn't
have killed her. There was something
wrong with what she took.

ALABAMA
You mean she got a bad batch?

CLARENCE
That's what happened. In fact, when
she died, it was considered to be
the happiest time of her life. She'd
been fucked over so much by men, she
didn't trust them. She's having
this relationship with this guy and
he asked her to marry him. Now,
other people had asked to marry
her before, but she couldn't be
sure whether they really loved her
or were just after her money. So
she said no. And the guy says,
'Look I really love you and I wanna
prove it. So have your lawyers
draw up a paper that says no matter
what happens, I can never get any
of your money, and I'll sign it.'
So she did, and he did and he asked
her and she said yes. And once
they were engaged, he told her a
secret about himself that she
never knew; he was a millionaire.

ALABAMA
So he really loved her?

CLARENCE
Uh-huh.

INT. CLARENCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
It's the next day. Clarence wakes up in his bed alone.
He looks around and no Alabama, but the skylight to the
roof is open.
The stairs are down. Clarence pulls on a large ratty
fur coat salvaged from a thrift shop and heads for the
roof.

EXT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT (DOWNTOWN DETROIT) - ROOF

DAWN
It is early, a time when even Detroit looks beautiful.
Clarence's run-down Victorian apartment building is
dwarfed between Gotham City high rises and 70's glass
behemoths.
On the roof is an enormous Marlboro billboard -- Monument
Valley frames the All American cowboy. On the catwalk,
in a strange green underlight, which illuminates the
billboard, is Alabama. She is sitting on a yellow plastic
collapsible beach chair, swathed in a large overcoat and
blanket. This is Clarence's terrace where he often
surveys the city. He approaches Alabama along the cat-
walk. She tries to compose herself.

CLARENCE
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I
do something? What did I do?

ALABAMA
You didn't do nothin'.

CLARENCE
Did you hurt yourself?
(he takes her foot)
What'd ya do? Step on thumbtack.
Clarenc unfolds a second beach chair and sits next to
Alabama.

ALABAMA
Clarence, I've got something to
tell you. I didn't just happen
to be at that theater. I was paid
to be there.

CLARENCE
What are you, a theater checker?
You check up on the box office
girls? Make sure they're not
ripping the place off.

ALABAMA
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a
call girl.
Pause.

CLARENCE
You're a whore?

ALABAMA
I'm a call girl, there is a
difference, you know.
(she takes a deep
breath, between sobs)
I don't know, maybe there's not.
That place you took me to last
night, that comic book place.

CLARENCE
Heros For Sale?

ALABAMA
Here goes: you got a boss, right?

CLARENCE
Yeah... I got a boss. I work at
'Heroes For Sale.' It's a comic
book store. It's great because
most of the customers only come
in to browse. So I can pretty
much do...

ALABAMA
(cuts him off)
What's his name?

CLARENCE
My boss... my boss is called
Lance.

ALABAMA
That's him. He called where I
work and ordered a girl for you.
He told them that you didn't get
out much and he wanted you to get
laid... Seein' it was your
birthday and all. But he didn't
want me just to show up. He
wanted me to act like I picked you
up. The plan was for me to bump
into you, pick you up, spend the
night and skip out after you fell
asleep. I was gonna write you a
note and say that this was my
last day in America. That I was
leavin' on a plane this morning
to the Ukraine to marry a rich
millionaire, and thank you for
making my last day in America my
best day.

CLARENCE
That dazzling imagination.

ALABAMA
It's on your TV. Shine reading
it. All it says is: 'Dear
Clarence.'
I couldn't write anymore. I didn't
want to ever see you again. In
fact, it's stupid not to ever see
you again. Last night... I don't
know... I felt... I hadn't had that
much fun since Girl Scouts. So I
just said, 'Alabama, come clean.
Let him know, what's what, and if
he tells you to go fuck yourself
then go back to Drexl and fuck
yourself.'

CLARENCE
Who and what is a Drexl?

ALABAMA
My pimp.

CLARENCE
You have a pimp?

ALABAMA
Uh-huh.

CLARENCE
A real live pimp?

ALABAMA
Uh-huh.

CLARENCE
Is he black?

ALABAMA
He thinks he is. He says his
mother was Apache, but I suspect
he's lying.

CLARENCE
Is he nice?

ALABAMA
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to
call him nice, but he's treated
me pretty decent. But I've only
been there about four days. He
got a little rough with Arlene the
other day.

CLARENCE
What did he do to Arlene?

ALABAMA
Slapped her around a little.
Punched her in the stomach. It
was pretty scary.

CLARENCE
This motherfucker sounds charming!
Clarence is on his feet, furious.

CLARENCE
God damn it, Alabama, you gotta
get the fuck outta there! How
much longer before he's slappin'
you around? Punchin' you in the
stomach? How the fuck did you
get hooked up with a douche bag
like this in the first place?

ALABAMA
At the bus station. He said I'd
be a perfect call girl. And that
he knew an agency in California
that, on his recommendation, would
handle me. They have a very
exclusive clientele: movie stars,
big business men, total white
collar. And all the girls in the
agency get a grand a night. At
least five hundred. They drive
Porsches, live in condos, have
stockbrokers, carry beepers, you
know, like Nancy Allen in Dressed
To Kill. And when I was ready he'd
call 'em, give me a plane ticket,
and send me on my way. He says
he makes a nice finder's fee for
finding them hot prospects. But
no one's gonna pay a grand a night
for a girl who doesn't know
whether to shit or wind her watch.
So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is
just sorta learnin' the ropes. It
seemed like a lotta fun, but I
don't really like it much, till
last night. You were only my
third trick, but you didn't feel
like a trick. Since it was a
secret, I just pretended I was
on a date. And, um, I guess I
want a second date.

CLARENCE
Thank you. I wanna see you again
too. And again, and again, and
again. Bama, I know we haven't
known each other long, but my
parents went together all through
high school, and they still got a
divorce. So fuck it, you wanna
marry me?

ALABAMA
What?

CLARENCE
Will you be my wife?
When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.

ALABAMA
Yes.

CLARENCE
( a little surprised)
You will?

ALABAMA
You better not be fuckin' teasin'
me.

CLARENCE
You better not be fuckin' teasin'
me.
They seal it with a kiss.

CLOSEUP - ALABAMA'S WEDDING RING - LATER THAT NIGHT
PULL BACK to reveal the newlyweds are both snuggling up
together on the couch watching TV. The movie they're
watching is "The Incredible One Armed Boxer vs. the
Master of the Flying Guillotine." Alabama watches the
screen, but every so often she looks down to admire
the ring on her hand.

CLARENCE
Did ya ever see The Chinese
Professionals?

ALABAMA
I don't believe so.

CLARENCE
Well, that's the one that explains
how Jimmy Wang Yu became the
Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
We hear, O.S., the TV ANNOUNCER say:

TV ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
We'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in...
The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs.
The Master of the Flying Guillotine,
tonight's eight o'clock movie, after
these important messages...
Clarence looks at the TV.
He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his.
We see commercials playing.
He turns in her direction.
She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring.
He smiles and turns back to the TV.
More commercials.
DOLLY CLOSE ON Clarence's face.

FLASH ON
Alabama, right after he proposed.

ALABAMA
You better not be fuckin' teasin'
me.

FLASH ON
In a cute, all-night wedding chapel. Clarence dressed in
a rented tuxedo and Alabama in a rented white wedding
gown.

ALABAMA
I do.

CLARENCE
Thank you.

FLASH ON
Clarence and Alabama, dressed in tux and gown, doing a
lover's waltz on a ballroom dance floor.

FLASH ON
Clarence and Alabama in a taxi cab.

CLARENCE
Hello, Mrs. Worley.

ALABAMA
How do you do, Mr. Worley?

CLARENCE
Top-o-the morning to you, Mrs.
Worley.

ALABAMA
Bottom of the ninth, Mr. Worley.
Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have
you seen your lovely wife today?

CLARENCE
Oh, you're speaking of my charming
wife, Mrs. Alabama Worley.

ALABAMA
Of course. Are there others, Mr.
Worley?
Moving on top of her.

CLARENCE
Not for me.
He starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat.
She resists.

ALABAMA
(playfully)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

CLARENCE
(playfully)
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes...

EXT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY
Seedy hole in the wall tattoo parlor framed between a
Chinese take-away and a laundromat. Clarence's car sits
with two wheels up on the curb.

INT. TATTOO PARLOR - CLOSE ON NEEDLE - DAY
colorizing a red banner. The banner reads: CLARENCE. A
little airborne cherub sports the banner. Alabama is face
down on a table sweating, gripping Clarence's hands. He
is sporting a mirror tattoo on his upper arm but this time
the banner reads: ALABAMA and the cherub is releasing an
arrow from his bow.
An aging English punk rocker wearing baggy shorts, an
assortment of strange body tattoos and Doc Martins,
performs the surgery on Alabama's butt. BILLY IDOL'S
"White Wedding" booms through the small sweaty space.
As Alabama goes through the painful tattoo, she fills
Clarence in on her history.

ALABAMA
... I want you to know for instance
I wasn't the school whore. I had
a boyfriend in Junior high, David,
he played basketball. Then he
moved away and I didn't have a
boyfriend again for a year. Then
at the end of my junior year I got
another boyfriend, Glenn.

CLARENCE
What was he?

ALABAMA
Chinese. Anyway, we went together
for a little while then broke up.
I'm telling you all this so you'll
understand I'm not what we call
in Florida, white trash. I'm a
very nice person. And when it
comes to relationships I'm totally
one hundred percent 'managama' --
'manamama.'

CLARENCE
You stay with one guy.

ALABAMA
Exactly. If I'm with you, I'm
with you. I don't want anybody
else. Everything I just said is
the truth so maybe you won't hold
any lies I said last night against
me too much.

CLARENCE
Baby doll, last night was one of
the greatest nights of my life.
So stop apologizing for making my
dreams come true.

FLASH ON
A big mean-looking black man in PIMP clothes.

PIMP
Bitch, you better git yo ass back
on the street an' git me my money!

FLASH ON
Pimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving
a sales pitch to a potential customer.

PIMP
I'm tellin' you, my man, this
bitch is fine. This girl's a
freak! You can fucker in the ass,
fucker in the mouth. Rough stuff
too. She's a freak for it. Jus'
try not to fucker up for life.

FLASH ON
Pimp beating Alabama.

PIMP
You holdin' out on me, girl? Bitch,
you never learn!

FLASH ON
Alabama passionately kissing the uninterested pimp.

PIMP
Hang it up, momma. I got no time
for this bullshit.

BACK TO:

TV WITH KUNG FU ON IT

BACK TO:

CLARENCE'S FACE
There's definitely something different about his eyes.
Clarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom.
Alabama's startled by his sudden movement.

ALABAMA
(yelling after him)
Where you goin', honey?

CLARENCE (O.S.)
I just gotta get somethin'.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
Clarence splashes water on his face trying to wash away
the images that keep polluting his mind. Then, he hears
a familiar voice.

ELVIS PRESLEY (O.S.)
Well? Can you live with it?
Clarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to ELVIS
PRESLEY. Clarence isn't surprised to see him.

CLARENCE
What?

ELVIS
Can you live with it?

CLARENCE
Live with what?

ELVIS
With that sonofabitch walkin'
around breathin' the same air as
you? And gettin' away with it
every day. Are you haunted?

CLARENCE
Yeah.

ELVIS
You wanna get unhaunted?

CLARENCE
Yeah.

ELVIS
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in
the face. And feed that boy to
the dogs.

CLARENCE
I can't believe what the fuck
you're telling me.

ELVIS
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm
just sayin' what I'd do.

CLARENCE
You'd really do that?

ELVIS
He don't got no right to live.

CLARENCE
Look, Elvis, he is haunting me.
He doesn't deserve to live. And
I do not want to kill him. But I
don't want ta go to jail for the
rest of my life.

ELVIS
I don't blame you.

CLARENCE
If I thought I could get away
with it --

ELVIS
Killin' 'em's the hard part.
Gettin' away with it is the
easy part. Whaddya think the
cops do when a pimp's killed?
Burn the midnight oil tryin' to
find who done it? They couldn't
give a flyin' fuck if all the
pimps in the whole wide world
took two in the back of the
fuckin' head. If you don't get
caught at the scene with the
smokin' gun in your hand, you
got away with it.
Clarence looks at Elvis.

ELVIS
Clarence, I like ya. Always
have, always will.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CLOSE ON SNUBNOSEED

.38 - NIGHT
which Clarence loads and sticks in a heavy athletic
sock he's wearing.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Clarence returns.

CLARENCE
Sweetheart, write down your
former address.

ALABAMA
What?

CLARENCE
Write down Drexl's address.

ALABAMA
Why?

CLARENCE
So I can go over there and pick up
your things.

ALABAMA
(really scared)
No, Clarence. Just forget it,
babe. I jus' wanna disappear
from there.
He kneels down before her and holds her hand.

CLARENCE
Look, sweetheart, he scares you
but I'm not scared of that
motherfucker. He can't touch you
now. You're completely out of
his reach. He poses absolutely
no threat to us. So if he doesn't
matter, which he doesn't it would
be stupid to lose your things now,
wouldn't it?

ALABAMA
You don't know him --

CLARENCE
You don't know me. Not when it
comes to shit like this. I have
to do this. I need for you to
know you can count on me to
protect you. Now write down his
address.

CUT TO:

INT/EXT. RED MUSTANG - DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREETS - TWILIGHT
Image what Bel Air would be like if the crime rate got so
bad that people just said "fuck it" and left. The dealers,
pimps, and filth of the world have taken over. They just
moved right into the large Victorian mansions that at one
time were nice. That time is gone for sure, all the houses
that still stand are in an accelerated state of decay.
Between the houses, in what was once spacious grounds,
there now exists only no-man's lands where all of the
deals take place. The living dead of the drug world
wander about.
Clarence drives through all of this until he gets to
the address written on the TV Guide.

EXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET - TWILIGHT
It's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his
red Mustang. He's right smack dab in the middle of a
bad place to be in the daytime.
He checks his pulse on his neck, it's beating like a
race horse. To pump himself up, he does a quick Elvis
Presley gyration.

CLARENCE
(in Elvis' voice)
Yeah... yeah...
He starts walking into the large open field.

EXT. NO-MAN'S LAND FIELD - TWILIGHT
Clarence has a beat to his stride that says "confidence."
But with each step into the dimly lit expanse, thoughts of
"what the hell am I doing" begin creeping into his mind.
In the b.g., against the dilapidated mansions, Clarence
can see the eerie glow that at one time may have been
fireflies... today it's crack pipes.
Clarence approaches JUPITER, a diseased-looking dealer/
junkie who thinks Clarence is there to score.

JUPITER
My man, let me show you to the
white lady.
This stops Clarence cold.

JUPITER
I got crack, crank, smack, dope...
man, I sell hope. Send you to the
moon and back. Then some.
Clarence walks past him like a man on a mission.

JUPITER
Chill, man, life ain't that bad.
And Jupiter walks off to confront another customer.
Clarence makes his way, more confident than ever,
toward the door of a large, dark Victorian mansion.

EXT. DARK VICTORIAN - TWILIGHT
Clarence steps up to the massive door of the house.
His heart's really racing now. He has the TV Guide
that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand.
He KNOCKS on the door using the HUGE KNOCKERS.
Marty answers the door.

MARTY
You want somethin'?

CLARENCE
Drexl?

MARTY
Nah, man. I'm Marty. Whatcha
want?

CLARENCE
I gotta talk to Drexl.

MARTY
Well, what the fuck you wanna
tell him?

CLARENCE
It's about Alabama.
A figure appears in the doorway, wearing a yellow Farrah
Fawcett T-shirt. It's our friend, Drexl.

DREXL
Where the fuck is that bitch?

CLARENCE
She's with me.

DREXL
Who the fuck are you?

CLARENCE
I'm her husband.

DREXL
Well, that makes us practically
related. Bring your ass on in.

INT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room
continuing a conversation they were having and leaving
Clarence standing in the doorway.
This is not the confrontation Clarence expected. He
trails in behind Drexl and Marty.

DREXL
(to Marty)
What was I sayin'?

MARTY
Rock whores.

DREXL
You ain't seen nothin' like these
rock whores. They ass be young,
man. They got that fine young
pussy. Bitches want the rock they
be freak for you. They give you
hips, lips and the fingertips.
Drexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.

DREXL
(to Clarence)
You know what I'm talking about?
Drexl gestures to one of the three stoned hookers
lounging about on couches in the large living room that
has been transformed from something dignified to a
cesspool.

DREXL
(to Marty)
These bitches over here ain't shit.
You stomp them bitches to death to
get the kinda pussy I'm talking
about.
Drexl sits down on the couch with a card table in
front of it scattered with take-out boxes of Chinese
food. The black exploitation movie The Mack with
Max Julian is playing on the TV. This is not how
Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is
exactly what he expected Drexl to be like.
He positions himself in front of the food table,
demanding Drexl's attention.

DREXL
(eating with chopsticks;
to Clarence)
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some
dinner? Grab yourself an eggroll.
We got everything here from a
diddle-eyed joe to a damned-if-I-know.

CLARENCE
No thanks.

DREXL
No thanks? What does that mean?
Means you ate before you came on
down here? All full? Is that it?
Nah, I don't think so. I think
you're too scared to be eatin'.
Now, see, we're sitting down
here ready to negotiate, and
you've already given up your shit.
I'm still a mystery to you. But,
I know exactly where your ass is
comin' from. See, if I asked
you if you wanted some dinner and
you grabbed an eggroll and started
to chow down, I'd say to myself
'This motherfucker's carryin' on
like he ain't got a care in the
world. Who knows, maybe he don't.
Maybe this fool's such a bad
motherfucker, he don't got to
worry about nothin'. He jus' sit
down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV.'
See? You ain't even sat down yet.
On that TV there, since you been in
the room, is a woman with her titties
hangin' out, and you ain't even
bothered to look. You jus' been
starin' at me. Now, I know I'm
pretty, but I ain't as pretty as
a couple a titties.
Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.

CLARENCE
I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not
hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause
I'm not stayin'. I'm not lookin'
at the movie 'cause I saw it seven
years ago. It's The Mack with Max
Julian, Carol Speed and Richard
Pryor, written by Bobby Poole,
directed by Michael Campus, and
released by Cinema Releasing
Company in nineteen-seventy-four.
I'm not scared of you. I just
don't like you. In that envelope
is some payoff money. Alabama's
moving on to some greener pastures.
We're not negotiating. I don't
like to barter. I don't like to
dicker. I never have fun in
Tijuana. That price is non-
negotiable. What's in that
envelope is for my peace of mind.
My peace of mind is worth that
much. Not one penny more, not
one penny more.
You could hear a pin drop in the room. Once Clarence
started talking, Marty went on full alert. Drexl
stopped eating and the whores stopped breathing. All
eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and
opens the envelope. It's empty.

DREXL
It's empty.
Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says
"That's right, asshole." Silence.

DREXL
Oooooooo eeeeeeee! This child is
terrible. Marty, you know what we
got here? Motherfuckin' Charlie
Bronson. Is that who you supposed
to be, Mr. Majestyk ? Looky, here,
Charlie, none of this shit is
necessary. I ain't got no hold on
Alabama. I jus' tryin' to lend
the girl a helpin' hand.
Before Drexl finishes the sentence, he picks up the card
table and throws it at Clarence, catching him off guard.
Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around
his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold.
Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his
elbow in the solar plexus. We'll never know whether that
blow had any effect because just at that moment Drexl
takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.
All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple
of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to
the floor in a shower of LP's.
Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile hasn't let go of
Clarence.
Since Drexl's on top he starts slamming his fists into
Clarence's face.
Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't
do a whole lot about it.

DREXL
Ya wanna fuck wit' me?
(hits Clarence)
Ya wanna fuck wit' me?
(hits Clarence)
I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit'!
He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.
Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of
Drexl's face and digs his nails in. He sticks his thumb in
Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek and starts twisting.
Marty, who's in even worse of a position, can't do any-
thing but tighten his grip around Clarence's neck until
Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of
his head.
Drexl's face is getting torn up but he's also biting
down hard on Clarence's thumb.
Clarence raises his head and brings it down hard,
crunching Marty's face and busting his nose.
Marty loosens his grip on Clarence's neck.
Clance wriggles free and gets up onto his knees.
Drexl and Clarence are now on even footing, but awkward
footing it is. The two are going at each other like a
pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, just keep-
ing them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much
damage to each other because their positions, almost like
a hockey fight.
Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the
head with a stack of LP's. This disorients Clarence.
Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet.
Drexl socks him in the face. One, two, three! Then he
kicks him hard in the balls.
Marty lets go and Clarence hits the floor like a sack of
potatoes. He curls up into a fetal position and holds
his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.
Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.
Marty has blood streaming down his face from his nose
and onto his shirt.

DREXL
(to Marty)
You okay? That stupid dumb-ass
didn't break your nose, did he?

MARTY
Nah. It don't feel so good but
it's all right.
Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground, hurting.

DREXL
(to Clarence)
You see what you get when you fuck
wit' me, white boy? You're gonna
walk in my goddamn house, my house!
Gonna come in here and tell me!
Takin' that smack in front of my
employees. Shit! Your ass mus'
be crazy.
(to Marty)
I don't think this white boy's got
good sense. Hey, Marty.
(laughing)
He must o' thought it was white
boy day. It ain't white boy day,
is it?

MARTY
(laughing)
Nah, man, it ain't white boy day.

DREXL
(to Clarence)
Shit, man, you don't fucked up
again. Next time you Bogart your
way into a nigger's crib and get
all in his face, make sure you do
it on white boy day.

CLARENCE
(hurting)
Wannabee Nigger...

DREXL
Fuck you! My mother was Apache!
Drexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.
Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in
his jacket.
Clarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls
still has him down.
Drexl finds the wallet and pulls it out. He flips it
open to the driver's license.

DREXL
Well, well, well, looky what we
got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds
almost like a nigger name.
(to Clarence)
Hey, dummy.
He puts his foot on Clarence's chest.

CLARENCE'S POV
as he looks up.

DREXL
Before you brought your dumb ass
through the door, I didn't know
shit. I just chalked it up to
au revoir, Alabama. But because
you think you're some macho
motherfucker, I know who she's
with. You. I know who you are,
Clarence Worley. And I know where
you live, 4900 116th Street,
apartment 48. And I'll make a
million dollar bet Alabama's at
the same address. Marty, take the
car and go get 'er. Bring her
dumb ass back here.

BACK TO SCENE
He hands Marty the driver's license. Marty goes to get
the car keys and a jacket.

DREXL
(to Marty)
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.
(to Clarence)
You know the first thing I think
I'll do when she gets here? I
think I'll make her suck my dick
and I'll come all in her face.
I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's
done it before. But I want you as
an audience.
(hollering to Marty)
Marty, what the fuck are you
doing?

MARTY (O.S.)
I'm trying to find my jacket.

DREXL
Look in the hamper. Linda's been
dumpin' everybody's stray clothes
there lately.
While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty,
Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the .38.
He sticks the barrel between Drexl's legs.
Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in
time to see Clarence pull the trigger and BLOW his balls
to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.
Drexl shrieks in horror and pain and falls to the ground.

MARTY (O.S.)
What's happening?
Marty steps into the room.
Clarence doesn't hesitate. He SHOOTS Marty four times in
the chest.
Two of the three hookers run out of the front door scream-
ing. The other hooker is curled up in the corner. She's
too stoned to run, but stoned enough to be terrified.
Drexl, still alive, is lying on the ground, howling,
holding what's left of his balls and dick.
Clarence points the gun at the remaining hooker.

CLARENCE
Get a bag and put Alabama's things
in it!
She doesn't move.

CLARENCE
You wanna get shot? I ain't got
all fuckin' day, so move it!
The hooker, tears of fear running her mascara, grabs a
suitcase from under the bed, and on her hands and knees,
pushes it along the floor to Clarence.
Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl,
who's curled up like a pillbug.

CLOSEUP - CLARENCE'S FORGOTTEN DRIVER'S LICENSE
in Marty's bloody hand.

BACK TO SCENE
Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.

CLARENCE
(to Drexl)
Open your eyes, laughing boy.
He doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick.

CLARENCE
Open your eyes!
He does. It's now...

DREXL'S POV
from the floor.

CLARENCE
You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?
He FIRES.

CLOSEUP
The bullet comes out of the gun and heads RIGHT TOWARDS us.
When it REACHES us, the screen goes AWASH IN RED.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The front door swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama
jumps off the couch and runs toward Clarence, before she
reaches him he blurts out.

CLARENCE
I killed him.
She stops short.

CLARENCE
I've got some food in the car,
I'll be right back.
Clarence leaves. Except for the TV PLAYING, the room
is quiet. Alabama sits on the couch.
Clarance walks back into the room with a whole bounty of
take-out food. He heaps it onto the coffee table and
starts to chow down.

CLARENCE
Help yourself. I got enough.
I am fuckin' starvin'. I think
I ordered one of everything.
He stops and looks at her.

CLARENCE
I am so hungry.
He starts eating french fries and hamburgers.

ALABAMA
(in a daze)
Was it him or you?

CLARENCE
Yeah. But to be honest, I put
myself in that position. When I
drove up there I said to myself,
'If I can kill 'em and get away with
it, I'll do it.' I could. So
I did.

ALABAMA
Is this a joke?

CLARENCE
No joke. This is probably the
best hamburger I've ever had. I'm
serious, I've never had a
hamburger taste this good.
Alabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring
her.

CLARENCE
Come on, Bama, eat something.
You'll feel better.
She continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her.
Finally, he spins on her yellling:

CLEARANCE
Why are you crying? He's not worth
one of your tears.
Would you rather it been me? Do
you love him?
(no answer)
Do you love him?
(no answer)
Do you love him?
She looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a
word out.

ALABAMA
I think what you did was...

CLARENCE
What?

ALABAMA
I think what you did...

CLARENCE
What?

ALABAMA
I think what you did...

CLARENCE
What?

ALABAMA
... was so romantic.
Clarence is completely taken aback. They meet in a long
passionate lovers' kiss. Their kiss breaks and slowly the
world comes back to normal.

ALABAMA
I gotta get outta these clothes.

CLARENCE
I have your things right here.
He picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in
front of them.

ALABAMA
(comically)
Clean clothes. There is a God.
Clarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama and her
husband's jaws drop.

ALABAMA
Clarence. Those aren't my clothes.

CUT TO:

EXT. CLIFF'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING
A big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a
sunrise sky as a backdrop. The song "Little Bitty Tear"
is heard acappella.

INT. CLIFF'S CAR - MOVING - MORNING
CLIFFORD WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing
this song gently to the sunrise. He's a forty-five year
old ex-cop, present security guard. In between singing
he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed
in a security guard uniform.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - MORNING
Cliff's Nova pulls in as he keeps crooning. He pulls up to
his trailer to see something that stops him short.

CLIFF'S POV (THROUGH WINDSHIELD) - TRAILER PARK
Clarence and Alabama are waiting for him in front of his
trailer.

CLOSEUP ON CLIFF
Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down
Cliff's cheek.

BACK TO POV
Clarence and Alabama walk over to the car. Clarence
sticks his face through the driver's side window.

CLARENCE
Good morning, Daddy, long time no see.

INT. TRAILER HOME - MORNING
All three enter the trailer home.

CLIFF
Excuse the place, I haven't been
entertaining company as of late.
Sorry if I'm acting a little
dense, but you're the last person
in the world I expected to see
this morning.
Clarence and Alabama walk into the living room.

CLARENCE
Yeah, well, that's okay, Daddy.
I tend to have that effect on
people. I'm dyin' of thirst,
you got anything to drink?
He moves past Cliff and heads straight for the refrigerator.

CLIFF
I think there's a Seven-Up in
there.

CLARENCE
(rummaging around
the fridge)
Anything stronger?
(pause)
Oh, probaby not. Beer? You
can drink beer, can't you?

CLIFF
I can, but I don't.

CLARENCE
(closing the fridge)
That's about all I ever eat.
Cliff looks at the girl. She smiles sweetly at him.

CLIFF
(to girl)
I'm sorry... I'm his father.

ALABAMA
(sticks her hand out)
That's okay, I'm his wife.
(shaking his hand
vigorously)
Alabama Worley, please to meetcha.
She is really pumping his arm, just like a used car
salesman, however that's where the similarities end,
because she's totally sincere.
Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch
of little ceramic fruit magnets in his hand. He throws
his other arm around Alabama.

CLARENCE
Oh yeah, we got married.
(referring to magnets)
You still have these!
(to Alabama)
This isn't a complete set, when
I was five I swallowed the
pomegranate one. I never shit it
out, so I guess it's still there.
Loverdoll, why don't you be a sport
and go get us some beer. I want
some beer.
(to Cliff)
Do you want some beer? Well, if
you want some it's here.
He hands her some money and his car keys.

CLARENCE
Go to the liquor store --
(to Cliff)
Where is there a liquor store
around here?

CLIFF
Uh, yeah.. there's a party store
down 54th.

CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
Get a six-pack of something
imported. It's hard to tell you
what to get 'cause different places
have different things. If they got
Fosters, get that, if not ask the
guy at the thing what the strongest
imported beer he has is. Look,
since you're making a beer run,
would you mind too terribly if you
did a food run as well. I'm
fuckin' starvin' to death. Are
you hungry too?

ALABAMA
I'm pretty hungry. When I went
to the store I was gonna get
some Ding-Dongs.

CLARENCE
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get
some real food. What would
taste good?
(to Cliff)
What do you think would taste
good?

CLIFF
I'm really not very --

CLARENCE
You know what would taste good?
Chicken. I haven't had chicken
in a while. Chicken would really
hit the spot about now.
Chicken and beer, definitely,
absolutely, without a doubt.
(to Cliff)
Where's a good chicken place
around here?

CLIFF
I really don't know.

CLARENCE
You don't know the chicken
places around where you live?
(to Alabama)
Ask the guy at the place where
a chicken place is.
He gives her some more money.

CLARENCE
This should cover it, Auggie-
Doggie.

ALABAMA
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
She opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his
dad as the door shuts.

CLARENCE
Isn't she the sweetest God damned
girl you ever saw in your whole
life? Is she a four alarm fire,
or what?

CLIFF
She seems very nice.

CLARENCE
Daddy. Nice isn't the word.
Nice is an insult. She's a
peach. That's the only word
for it, she's a peach. You
can tell I'm in love with her?
You can tell by my face, can't
ya? It's a dead giveaway.
It's written all over it.
Ya know what? She loves me
back. Take a seat, Pop, I
gotta talk --

CLIFF
Clarence, just shut up, you're
giving me a headache! I can't
believe how much like your mother
you are.
You're your fucking mother through
and through. I haven't heard from
ya in three years. Then ya show
up all of a sudden at eight o'clock
in the morning. You walk in like a
Goddamn bulldozer... don't get me
wrong, I'm happy to see you...
just slow it down. Now, when did
you get married?

CLARENCE
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble
and I really need your help.

INSERT - BLACK TITLE CARD - "HOLLYWOOD"

INT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
FOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sides in
their hands silently mouthing their lines. One of the
actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting director, MARY LOUISE
RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clipboard in hand.

RAVENCROFT
Dick Ritchie?
Dick pops up from the pack.

DICK
I'm me... I mean that's me.

RAVENCROFT
Step inside.

INT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
She sits behind a large desk. Her nameplate rests on
the desktop. Several posters advertising "The Return of
T.J. Hooker" hang on the wall.
Dick sits in a chair, holding his sides in his hands.

RAVENCROFT
Well, the part you're reading for
is one of the bad guys. There's
Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's
already been cast as Brian.
And you're reading for the part of
Marty. Now in this scene you're
both in a car and Bill Shatner's
hanging on the hood. And what
you're trying to do is get him off.
(picks up copy of
script)
Whenever you're ready.

DICK
(reading and pantomiming
he's driving)
Where'd he come from?

RAVENCROFT
(reading from the
script lifelessly)
I don't know. He just appeared
like magic.

DICK
(reading from script)
Well, don't just sit there.
Shoot him.
She puts her script down, and smiles at him.

RAVENCROFT
That was very good.

DICK
Thank you.

RAVENCROFT
If we decided on making him a
New York type, could you do that?

DICK
Sure. No problem.

RAVENCROFT
Could we try it now?

DICK
Absolutely.
Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with
a Brooklyn accent.

DICK
Where'd he come from?

RAVENCROFT
(monotone as before)
I don't know. He just appeared
like magic.

DICK
Well, don't just sit there,
shoot him.
Ravnecroft puts her script down.

RAVENCROFT
Well, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed.
You're a very fine actor.
Dick smiles.

INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY
Cliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to
come to grips with what Clarence has told him.

CLARENCE
Look, I know this is pretty heavy
duty, so if you wanna explode,
feel free.

CLIFF
You're always makin' jokes. That's
what you do, isn't it? Make jokes.
Makin' jokes is the one good thing
you're good at, isn't it? But
if you make a joke about this --
(raising his voice)
-- I'm gonna go completely out
of my fucking head!
Cliff pauses and collects himself.

CLIFF
What do you want from me?

CLARENCE
What?

CLIFF
Stop acting like an infant. You're
here because you want me to help
you in some way. What do you
need from me? You need money?

CLARENCE
Do you still have friends on
the force?

CLIFF
Yes, I still have friends on the
force.

CLARENCE
Could you find out if they know
anything? I don't think they know
shit about us. But I don't wanna
'think,' I wanna 'know.' You could
find out for sure what's goin' on.
(pause)
Daddy?

CLIFF
What makes you think I could
do that?

CLARENCE
You were a cop.

CLIFF
What makes you think I would
do that?

CLARENCE
I'm your son.

CLIFF
You've got it all worked out,
don't you?

CLARENCE
Look, Goddamnit, I never asked you
for a Goddamn thing! I've tried
to make your parental obligation
as easy as possible. After Mom
divorced you did I ever ask you
for anything? When I wouldn't
see ya for six months to a year
at a time, did I ever get in your
shit about it? No! It was always:
'Okay,' 'No problem,' 'You're a busy
guy, I understand.' The whole time
you were a drunk, did I ever point
my finger at you and talk shit?
No! Everybody else did. I never
did. you see, I know that you're
just a bad parent. You're not
really very good at it. But I
know you love me. I'm basically
a pretty resourceful guy. If I
didn't really need it I wouldn't
ask. And if you say no, don't
worry about it. I'm gone. No
problem.
Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag.

ALABAMA
The forager's back.

CLARENCE
Thank God. I could eat a horse
if you slap enough catsup on it.

ALABAMA
I didn't get any chicken.

CLARENCE
How come?

ALABAMA
It's nine o'clock in the morning.
Nothing's open.

EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY
Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang.
Alabama is amusing herself by doing cartwheels and
handstands in the background.

CLIFF
They have nothing. In fact,
they think it's drug related.

CLARENCE
Do tell. Why drug related?

CLIFF
Apparently Drexl had his big toe
stuck in shit like that.

CLARENCE
No shit?

CLIFF
Yeah, Drexl had an association with
a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name
mean anything to you?

CLARENCE
Nope.

CLIFF
If you don't hang around his circle,
no reason it should.

CLARENCE
Who is he?

CLIFF
Gangster. Drug dealer. Somebody
you don't want on your ass. Look,
Clarence, the more I hear about
this Drexl fucker, the more I
think you did the right thing. That
guy wasn't just some wild flake.

CLARENCE
That's what I've been tellin' ya.
The guy was like a mad dog. So
the cops aren't looking for me?

CLIFF
Nah, until they hear something
better they'll assume Drexl and Blue
Lou had a falling out. So once you
leave town I wouldn't worry about it.
Clarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.

CLARENCE
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really
came through for me.

CLIFF
I got some money I can give you --

CLARENCE
Keep it.

CLIFF
Well, son, I want you to know I
hope everything works out with you
and Alabama. I like her. I think
you make a cute couple.

CLARENCE
We do make a cute couple, don't we?

CLIFF
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble.
Remember, you gotta wife to think
about now. Quit fuckin' around.
(pause)
I love you, son.
They hug each other.
Clarence takes a piece of paper out and puts it into
Cliff's hand.

CLARENCE
This is Dick's number in Hollywood.
We don't know where we'll be, but
you can get a hold of me through him.
Clarence turns toward Alabama's direction and yells to her.

CLARENCE
Bama, we're outta here. Kiss
pops goodbye.
Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her
arms around Cliff and gives him a big smackeroo on the
lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's babbling
like a Fresca.

ALABAMA
'Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you
again real soon.

CLARENCE
(mock anger)
What kind of daughterly smackeroo
was that?

ALABAMA
Oh, hush up.
The two get into the Mustang.

CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
We'll send you a postcard as soon
as we get to Hollywood.
Clarence STARTS the ENGINE. The convertible roof opens
as they talk.

CLIFF
Bama, you take care of that one
for me. Keep him out of trouble.

ALABAMA
Don't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin'
this fella on a short leash.
Clarence, slowly, starts driving away.

CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
As the sun sets slowly in the
west we bid a fond farewell to all
the friends we've made... and with
a touch of melancholy we look
foreward to the time when we will
all be together again.
Clarence PEELS OUT, shooting a shower of gravel up in
the air.
As the Mustang disappears, Cliff runs his tongue over
his lips.

CLIFF
The son of a bitch was right...
she does tase like a peach.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY
Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor.
Things are pretty neat and clean. A nice stereo unit
sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet
dancer's feet hangs on the wall.
The PHONE RINGS. Dick answers.

DICK
Hi, Dick here.

INT. HOTEL SUITE (LAS VEGAS) - SUNSET
Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge
picture window overlooking the neon filled strip and the
flaiming red and orange sunset sky.
Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand.

CLARENCE
(big bopper voice)
Heeellllloooooo baaaabbbbbbyyyyy!
INTERCUT both sides of the conversation.

DICK
(unsure)
Clarence?

CLARENCE
You got it.

DICK
It's great to hear from you.

CLARENCE
Well, you're gonna be seein' me
shortly.

DICK
You comin' to L.A.? When?

CLARENCE
Tomorrow.

DICK
What's up? Why're ya leavin'
Detroit?
Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama,
wearing only a long T-shirt that has a big picture of
Bullwinkle, crawls up behind him.

CLARENCE
Well, there's a story behind all
that. I'll tell you when I see
you. By the way, I won't be
alone. I'm bringin' my wife
with me.

DICK
Get the fuck outta here!

CLARENCE
I'm a married man.

DICK
Get the fuck outta here!

CLARENCE
Believe it or not, I actually
tricked a girl into falling in
love with me. I'm not quite sure
how I did it. I'd hate to have
to do it again. But I did it.
Wanna say hi to my better half?
Before Dick can respond, Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.

ALABAMA
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.

DICK
Hello, Alabama.

ALABAMA
I can't wait to meet you.
Clarence told me all about you.
He said you were his best friend.
So, I guess that makes you my
best friend too.
He starts dictating to her what to say.

CLARENCE
Tell him we gotta go.

ALABAMA
Clarence says we gotta be
hittin' it.

DICK
What?

ALABAMA
Tell him we'll be hittin' his
area some time tomorrow.

ALABAMA
He said don't go nowhere. We'll
be there sometime tomorrow.

DICK
Wait a minute --

CLARENCE
Tell him not to eat anything.
We're gonna scarf when we get
there.

ALABAMA
Don't eat anything.

DICK
Alabama, could you tell Clar --

CLARENCE
Ask him if he got the letter.

ALABAMA
Did you get the letter?

DICK
What letter?

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
What letter?

CLARENCE
The letter I sent.

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
The letter he sent.

DICK
Clarence sent a letter?

CLARENCE
Has he gotten his mail today?

ALABAMA
Gotten your mail yet?

DICK
Yeah, my roommate leaves it on
the TV.

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Yes.

CLARENCE
Has he looked through it yet?

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Ya looked through it?

DICK
Not yet.

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Nope.

CLARENCE
Tell him to look through it.

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Get it.

DICK
Let me speak to Clarence.

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
He wants to speak with you.

CLARENCE
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him
to read the letter, the letter
explains all. Tell him I love
him. And tell him as of tomorrow,
all his money problems are over.

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
He can't. We gotta go, but he
wants you to read the letter.
The letter explains all. He wants
you to know he loves you. And he
wants you to know that as of
tomorrow, all of your money
problems are over.

DICK
Money problems?

CLARENCE
Now tell him good-bye.

ALABAMA
'Bye, 'bye.

CLARENCE
Now hang up.
She hangs up the phone.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY
Dick hears the CLICK on the other end.

DICK
Hello, hello. Clarence?
Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama
... hello?
Extremely confused, Dick hangs up the phone. He goes over
to the TV and picks up the day's mail. He goes through it.

ANGLE ON LETTER
It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick.
Dick opens it.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY
A lower, middle-class trailer park named "Astro World"
which has a neon sign in front of it in the shape of a
planet.
A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by
a trailer that's slightly less kept up than the others.
Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a fast
food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.

INT. TRAILER - DAY
He steps inside his doorway and then, before he knows
it, a gun is pressed to his temple and a big hand grabs
his shoulder.

GUN CARRIER
Welcome home, alchy. We're havin'
a party.
Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting
for him are four standing men: FRANKIE (young wise
guy), LENNY (an old wise guy), TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fire-
plug pitbull type) and VIRGIL (the quiet one).
Sitting in Cliff's reclining chair is VINCENZO COCCOTTI,
the Frank Nitti to Detroit mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.
Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the
sitting Coccotti. Frankie and Lenny pick him up and
roughly drop him in a chair.

COCCOTTI
(to Frankie)
Tell Tooth-Pic Vic to go outside
and do you-know-what.
Frankie tells Tooth-Pick Vic in Italian what Coccotti
said. He nods and exits.
Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Virgil
stands on one side of Cliff. Frankie and Lenny ransack
the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in
his hand, but he has yet to touch a drop.

COCCOTTI
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?

CLIFF
I give up. Who are you?

COCCOTTI
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me
in a vendetta kind of mood, you
will tell the angels in Heaven
that you had never seen pure evil
so singularly personified as you
did in the face of the man who
killed you. My name is Vincenzo
Coccotti. I work as council for
Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man who
your son stole from. I hear you
were once a cop so I can assume
you've heard of us before. Am
I correct?

CLIFF
I've heard of 'Blue Lou Boyle.'

COCCOTTI
I'm glad. Hopefully that will
clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am
question you've been asking yourself.
Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A,
and at the risk of sounding redundant,
please make your answers genuine.
(taking out a pack
of Chesterfields)
Want a Chesterfield?

CLIFF
No.

COCCOTTI
(as he lights one up)
I have a son of my own. About your
boy's age. I can imagine how
painful this must be for you. But
Clarence and that bitch whore girl
friend of his brought this all on
themselves. And I implore you not
to go down the road with 'em. You
can always take comfort in the
fact that you never had a choice.

CLIFF
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but
I haven't seen Clarence --
Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him
hard in the nose with his fist.

COCCOTTI
Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed
in the nose fucks you all up.
You got that pain shootin' through
your brain. Your eyes fill up
with water. It ain't any kind of fun.
But what I have to offer you,
that's as good as it's ever gonna
get, and it won't ever get that
good again. We talked to your
neighbors, they saw a Mustang,
a red Mustang, parked in front of
your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley,
have you seen your son?
Cliff's defeated.

CLIFF
I've seen him.

COCCOTTI
Now I can't be sure of how much
of what he told you. So in the
chance you're in the dark about
some of this, let me shed some
light. That whore your boy hangs
around with, her pimp is an
associate of mine, and I don't
just mean pimpin', in other
affairs he works for me in a
courier capacity. Well, apparently,
that dirty little whore found out
when we were gonna do some
business, 'cause your son, the
cowboy and his flame, came in the
room blastin' and didn't stop
'til they were pretty sure
everybody was dead.

CLIFF
What are you talkin' about?

COCCOTTI
I'm talkin' about a massacre.
They snatched my narcotics and
high-tailed it outta there. Wouldda
gotten away with it, but your son,
fuckhead that he is, left his driver's
license in a dead guy's hand. A
whore hiding in the commode filled
in all the blanks.

CLIFF
I don't believe you.

COCCOTTI
That's of minor importance. But
what's of major fucking importance
is that I believe you. Where did
they go?

CLIFF
On their honeymoon.

COCCOTTI
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same
question a second time. Where did
they go?

CLIFF
They didn't tell me.
Coccotti looks at him.,

CLIFF
Now, wait a minute and listen. I
haven't seen Clarence in three
years, yesterday he shows up here
with a girl, sayin' he got married.
He told me he needed some quick
cash for a honeymoon, so he
asked if he could borrow five
hundred dollars. I wanted to
help him out so I wrote out a
check. We went to breakfast
and that's the last I saw of him.
So help me God. They never thought
to tell me where they were goin'.
And I never thought to ask.
Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives
Virgil a look. Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs
Cliff's hands and turns it palm up. He then whips out a
butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours
Chivas Regal on the wound. Cliff screams.
Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.
Tooth-pick Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in
Italian that there's nothing in the car.
Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff
holds his bleeding palm in agony. Virgil hands him the
dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.

COCCOTTI
Sicilians are great liars. The
best in the world. I'm a
Sicilian. And my old man was
the world heavyweight champion of
Sicilian liars. And from growin'
up with him I learned the pantomime.
Now there are seventeen different
things a guy can do when he lies to
give him away. A guy has seventeen
pantomimes. A woman's got twenty,
but a guy's got seventeen. And if
ya know 'em like ya know your
own face, they beat lie detectors
all to hell. What we got here is
a little game of show and tell.
You don't wanna show me nothin'.
But you're tellin' me everything.
Now I know you know where they
are. So tell me, before I do
some damage you won't walk away
from.
The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the
awful pain in his heart. He looks deep into Coccotti's
eyes.

CLIFF
Could I have one of those
Chesterfields now?

COCCOTTI
Sure.
Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.

CLIFF
Gotta match?
Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.

CLIFF
Oh, don't bother. I got one.
(he lights the
cigarette)
So you're a Sicilian, huh?

COCCOTTI
(intensely)
Uh-huh.

CLIFF
You know I read a lot. Especially
things that have to do with history.
I find that shit fascinating. In
fact, I don't know if you know
this or not, Sicilian's were spawned
by niggers.
All the men stop what they are doing and look at Cliff,
except for Tooth-pick Vic who doesn't speak English and
so, isn't insulted.
Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing.

COCCOTTI
Come again?

CLIFF
It's a fact. Sicilians have
nigger blood pumping through their
hearts.
If you don't believe me look it
up. You see, hundreds and
hundreds of years ago the Moors
conquered Sicily. And Moors are
niggers. Way back then, Sicilians
were like the Wops in northern
Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes.
But, once the Moors moved in there,
they changed the whole country.
They did so much fuckin' with
the Sicilian women, they changed
the bloodline forever, from blond
hair and blue eyes to black hair
and dark skin. I find it
absolutely amazing to think that
to this day hundreds of years
later, Sicilians still carry that
nigger gene. I'm just quotin'
history. It's a fact. It's
written. Your ancestors were
niggers. Your great, great, great,
great grandmother was fucked by
a nigger, and had a half nigger
kid. That is a fact. Now tell
me, am I lyin'?
Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips
out an AUTOMATIC, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the
barrel to his temple, and PUMPS three bullets through
Cliff's head.
He pushes the body violently aside.
Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his feelings and
frustrated by the blood on his hands, he simply drops his
weapon and turns to his men.

COCCOTTI
I haven't killed anybody since
1974. Goddamn his soul to burn
for eternity in fucking hell for
making me spill blood on my hands!
Go to this comedian's son's
apartment and come back with
something that tells me where that
asshole went so I can wipe this
egg off of my face and fix this
fucked up family for good.
Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italian, asks
him "what was that all about?"
Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refrigerator has
found a beer.
When he closes the refrigerator door he finds a note
being held on be a ceramic banana fruit magnet that says:
"Clarence in LA: Dick Ritchie (Number and address).

LENNY
Boss, get ready to get happy.

TITLE CARD: "CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A."

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
The red Mustang enters Los Angeles.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - MORNING
Dick's asleep in a reclining chair. He's wearing his
clothes from the night before. His roommate FLOYD is
lying on the sofa watching TV.
The sound of four hands KNOCKING on his door wakes Dick
up. He shakes the bats out of his belfry, and opens the
door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles standing
in his doorway.
Clarence and Alabama immediately start singing "Hello My
Baby" like the frog in the old Chuck Jones cartoon.

CLARENCE AND ALABAMA
'Hello my baby,
Hello my honey,
Hello my ragtime gal --'

DICK
Hi, guys.
Alabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a
quick kiss. After she breaks, Clarence does the same.
Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick and into
his apartment.

CLARENCE
Wow. Neat place. Let's get some
breakfast. Oh, Dick, this is
Alabama, Alabama, this is Dick.

INT. PINK'S HOT DOG STAND - DAY
The Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as
they assemble the ultimate masterpiece hot dog.

EXT. PINK'S HOT DOG STAND - PATIO - DAY
Clarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor
table chowing down on chili dogs.
Alabama is in the middle of a story.

ALABAMA
... when my mom went into labor,
my dad panicked. He never had a
kid before, and crashed the car.
Now, picture this: their car's
demolished, a crowd is starting
to gather, my mom is yelling,
going into contractions, and
my dad, who was losing it before,
is now completely screaming yellow
zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as
if from thin air, this big giant
bus appears, and the bus driver
said, 'Get her in here.' He
forgot all about his route and
just drove straight to the
hospital. So, because he was
such a nice guy, they wanted to
name the baby after him, as a
sign of gratitude. Well, his
name was Waldo, and no matter
how grateful they were, even if
I'da been a boy, they wouldn't
call me Waldo. So, they asked
Waldo where he was from. And,
so there you go.

CLARENCE
And here we are.

DICK
That's a pretty amazing story.

CLARENCE
Well, she's a pretty amazing
girl. What are women like
out here?

DICK
Just like in Detroit, only
skinnier. Oh, guess what? I had
a really good reading for 'T.J.
Hooker' the other day.

ALABAMA
You're gonna be on 'T.J. Hooker'?

DICK
Knock wood.
He knocks the table and then looks at it.

DICK
... Formica. I did real well.
I think she liked me.

CLARENCE
Did you meet Captain Kirk?

DICK
You don't meet him in the
audition. That comes later.
Hope, hope.

ALABAMA
(finishing her
hot dog)
That was so good I'm gonna have
another.

DICK
You can't have just one.
Alabama leaves to get another hot dog. Clarence never
takes his eyes off her.

DICK
How much of that letter was on
the up and up?

CLARENCE
Every word of it.
Dick sees where Clarence's attention is.

DICK
You're really in love, aren't you?

CLARENCE
For the very first time in my life.
(pause)
Do you know what that's like?
Clarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer.

DICK
(regretfully)
No I don't.
(looks at Alabama)
How'd you two meet?
Clarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his
Hebrew cream soda.

CLARENCE
Do you remember the lyric?

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY
We see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. PAN TO the
parking lot where Clarence's empty red Mustang is parked.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - CLOSEUP -

DICK'S JAW - DAY
drops. His hand reaches O.S.

CLOSEUP - SUITCASE
The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is
full of cocaine! Dick's hand ENTERS FRAME and fondles a
bag.

BACK TO SCENE
Clarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.
Alabama's watching the cable TV.

DICK
Holy Mary mother of God.

ALABAMA
This is great, we got cable.

CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
Bama, you got your blade?
Keeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out a Swiss Army
knife with a tiny dinosaur on it from her purse, and
tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the corkscrew
and opens the wine.
In a couple of hotel plastic cups he pours some wine, a
big glass for Dick, a little one for himself. He hands
it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.

DICK
This shit can't be real.

CLARENCE
It'll getcha high.
He tosses Dick the knife.

CLARENCE
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?

ALABAMA
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
Using the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He
jumps back.

DICK
It's fuckin' real!
(to Clarence)
It's fuckin' real!

CLARENCE
I certainly hope so.

DICK
You've got a helluva lot of coke
there, man!

CLARENCE
I know.

DICK
Do you have any idea how much
fuckin' coke you got?

CLARENCE
Tell me.

DICK
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
He downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass.

DICK
This is Drexl's coke!?

CLARENCE
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's
coke and Clarence can do whatever
he wants with it. And what
Clarence wants to do is sell it.
Then me and Bama are gonna leave
on a jet plane and spend the rest
of our lives spendin'. So, you
got my letter, have you lined up
any buyers?

DICK
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe
Cocaine.
Dick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills it up.

CLARENCE
But you're an actor. I hear these
Hollywood guys have it delivered
to the set.

DICK
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I
start being a successful actor
I'll know those guys. But most
of the people I know are like me.
They ain't got a pot to piss in or
a window to throw it out of. Now,
if you want to sell a little bit
at at time --

CLARENCE
No way! The whole enchilada in
one shot.

DICK
Do you have any idea how difficult
that's gonna be?

CLARENCE
I'm offering a half a million
dollars worth of white for two
hundred thousand. How difficult
can that be?

DICK
It's difficult because you're
sellin' it to a particular group.
Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who
can use that kind of quantity.
Guys that can afford two hundred
thousand. Basically, guys I don't
know. You don't know. And more
important, they don't know you.
I did talk with one guy who
could possibly help you.

CLARENCE
Is he big league?

DICK
He's nothing. He's in my acting
class. But he works as an
assistant to a very powerful movie
producer named Lee Donowitz. I
thought Donowitz could be
interested in a deal like this.
He could use it. He could afford
it.

CLARENCE
What'dya tell 'em?

DICK
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure
from your letter what was bullshit,
and what wasn't.

CLARENCE
What's this acting class guy's
name?

DICK
Elliot.

CLARENCE
Elliot what?

DICK
Elliot Blitzer.

CLARENCE
Okay, call 'em up and arrange a
meeting, so we can get through
all the getting to know you stuff.

DICK
Where?

CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
Where?

ALABAMA
The zoo.

CLARENCE
(to Dick)
The zoo.
(pause)
What are you waiting for?

DICK
Would you just shut up a minute
and let me think?

CLARENCE
What's to think about?

DICK
Shut up! First you come waltzing
into my life after two years.
You're married. You killed a guy.

CLARENCE
Two guys.

DICK
Two guys. Now you want me to
help you with some big drug deal.
Fuck, Clarence, you killed
somebody and you're blowin' it
off like it don't mean shit.

CLARENCE
Don't expect me to be all broken
up over poor Drexl.
I think he was a fuckin',
freeloadin', parasitic scumbag,
and he got exactly what he
deserved. I got no pity for a mad
dog like that. I think I should
get a merit badge or somethin'.
Dick rests his head in his hands.

CLARENCE
Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin'
some pretty heavy shit on ya, but
I need you to rise to the occasion.
So, drink some more wine. Get
used to the idea, and get your
friend on the phone.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - CLOSEUP - PANTHER - DAY
A black panther, the four-legged kind, paces back and
forth. PULL BACK. Dick, and ELLIOT BLITZER are walking
through the zoo. One look at Elliot and you can see
what type of actor he is, a real GQ, blow-dry boy. As
they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal
crackers and Alabama is blowing soap bubbles.

ELLIOT
So you guys got five hundred
thousand dollars worth of cola
that you're unloading --

CLARENCE
Want an animal cracker?

ELLIOT
Yeah, okay.
He takes one.

CLARENCE
Leave the gorillas.

ELLIOT
-- that you're unloading for two
hundred thousand dollars --

CLARENCE
Unloading? That's a helluva way
to describe the bargain of a
lifetime.

DICK
(trying to chill
him out)
Clarence...

ELLIOT
Where did you get it?

CLARENCE
I grow it on my windowsill. The
light's really great there and
I'm up high enough so you can't
see it from the street.

ELLIOT
(forcing a laugh)
Ha ha ha. No really, where does
it come from?

CLARENCE
Coco leaves. You see, they take
the leaves and mash it down until
it's kind of a paste --

ELLIOT
(turning to Dick)
Look, Dick, I don't --

CLARENCE
(laughing)
No problem, Elliot. I'm just
fuckin' wit' ya, that's all.
Actually, I'll tell you but you
gotta keep it quiet. Understand,
if Dick didn't insure me you're
good people, I'd just tell ya,
none of your fuckin' business.
But, as a sign of good faith,
here it goes. I gotta friend in
the department.

ELLIOT
What department?

CLARENCE
What do you think, eightball?

ELLIOT
The police department?

CLARENCE
Duh. What else would I be talking
about? Now stop asking stupid
doorknob questions. Well, a year
and a half ago, this friend of
mine got access to the evidence
room for an hour. He snagged this
coke. But, he's a good cop with
a wife and a kid, so he sat on it
for a year and a half until he
found a guy he could trust.

ELLIOT
He trusts you?

CLARENCE
We were in 4-H together. We've
known each other since childhood.
So I'm handling the sales part.
He's my silent partner and he
knows, if I get fucked up, I won't
drop dime on him. He's kinda
paranoid. Now, no farther you
understand. I didn't tell you
nothin' and you didn't hear
nothin'.

ELLIOT
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
Elliot is more than satisfied. Clarence makes a comical
face at Dick when Elliot's not looking. Dick is wearing
an "I don't believe this guy" expression. Alabama is
forever blowing bubbles.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY
We're in the snack bar area of the zoo. Alabama, Dick
and Elliot are sitting around a plastic outdoor table.
Clarence is pacing around the table as he talks.
Alabama is still blowing bubbles.

CLARENCE
(to Elliot)
Do I look like a beautiful blonde
with big tits and an ass that
tastes like French vanilla ice
cream?
Elliot hasn't the faintest idea what this is supposed
to mean.

ELLIOT
What?

CLARENCE
Do I look like a beautiful blonde
with big tits and an ass that
tastes like French vanilla ice
cream?

ELLIOT
(with conviction)
No. No, you don't.

CLARENCE
Then why are you telling me all
this bullshit? Just so you can
fuck me?

DICK
(trying to calm
him down)
Clarence...!

CLARENCE
(to Dick)
Let me handle this.

ELLIOT
Get it straight. Lee isn't into
taking risks. He deals with a
couple of guys and he's been
dealing with them for years.
They're reliable. They're
dependable. And they're safe.

CLARENCE
Riddle me this, Batman. If
you're all so much in love with
each other, what the fuck are you
doing here? I'm sure you got
better things to do with your time
than walk around in circles
staring up a panther's ass. Your
guy's interested because with
that much shit at his fingertips
he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood
till the wheels come off. He can
sell it, he can snort it, he can
play Santa Claus with it. At the
price he's paying, he'll have the
freedom to be able to just throw
it around. He'll be everybody's
best friend. I'm not puttin' him
down. Hey, let him run wild.
Have a ball, it's his money. But
don't expect me to hang around
forever waiting for you guys to
grow some guts.
Elliot has been silenced. He nods his head in agreement.

INT. PORSCHE (MULHOLLAND DRIVE) - MOVING - DAY
Movie producer, LEE DONOWITZ, is driving his Porsche
through the winding Hollywood Hills, just enjoying being
rich and powerful. His cellular car PHONE RINGS, he
answers.

LEE
Hello.
(pause)
Elliot, it's Sunday. Why am I
talking to you on Sunday? I don't
see enough of you during the week,
I gotta talk to you on Sunday?
Why is it, you always --

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY
Elliot is on the zoo pay phone. Clarence is next to
him. Dick is next to Clarence. Alabama is next to
Dick, blowing bubbles.

ELLIOT
(on phone)
I'm with that party you wanted
me to get together with. Do you
know what I'm talking about, Lee?

INT. PORSCHE - MOVING - DAY

LEE
Why the hell are you calling my
phone to talk about that?

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY

ELLIOT
Well, he's here right now and he
insists on talking to you.

INT. PORSCHE (IN TUNNEL) - MOVING - DAY
In the tunnel Lee's VOICE ECHOES.

LEE
Are you out of your fucking mind?

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY

ELLIOT
He said if I didn't get you on
the --
Clarence takes the receiver out of Elliot's hand.

CLARENCE
(into phone)
Hello, Lee, it's Clarence. At
last we meet.

EXT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY
Virgil's knocking on Dick's door. FLOYD, Dick's
roommate, answers.

VIRGIL
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?

FLOYD
Naw, he ain't home right now.

VIRGIL
Do you live here?

FLOYD
Yeah, I live here.

VIRGIL
Sorta roommates?

FLOYD
Exactly roommates.

VIRGIL
Maybe you can help me. Actually,
who I'm looking for is a friend
of ours from Detroit. Clarence
Worley? I heard he was in town.
Might be traveling with a pretty
girl named Alabama. Have you
seen him? Are they stayin' here?

FLOYD
Naw, they ain't staying here. But
I know who you're talking about.
They're staying at the Hollywood
Holiday Inn.

VIRGIL
How do you know? You been there?

FLOYD
No, I ain't been there but I heard
him say it. Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Kinda easy to remember.

VIRGIL
You're right. It is.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY
Clarence is still on the phone with Lee.

CLARENCE
Lee, the reason I'm talking with
you is I want to open Dr. Zhivago
in L.A. And I want you to
distribute it.

INT. PORSCHE - MOVING - DAY
stopped in traffic on Sunset Boulevard.

LEE
I don't know, Clarence. Dr.
Zhivago's a pretty big movie.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY

CLARENCE
The biggest. The biggest movie
you've ever dealt with, Lee.
We're talkin' a lot of film. A
man'd have ta be an idiot not to
be a little cautious about a
movie like that. And, Lee,
you're no idiot...

INT. PORSCHE - MOVING - DAY
Still stuck on Sunset Boulevard, traffic's moving
better now.

LEE
I'm not saying I'm not interested.
But being a distributor's not
what I'm all about. I'm a film
producer. I'm on this world to
make good movies. Nothing more.
Now, having my big toe dipped into
the distribution end helps me on
many levels.
Traffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The b.g. whizzes
past him.

LEE
But the bottom line is -- I'm not
Paramount. I have a select group
of distributors I deal with. I
buy their little movies.
Accomplish what I wanna accomplish.
End of story. Easy, businesslike,
very little risk.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY

CLARENCE
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every
time you buy one of those little
movies, it's a risk. I'm not
selling you somethin' that's gonna
play two weeks, six weeks, then
go straight to cable. This is
Doctor Zhivago. This'll be
packin' 'em in for a year and a
half. Two years! That's two
years you don't have to work
with anybody's movie but mine.

INT. PORSCHE - MOVING - DAY
Porsche is now speeding down a beachside road.

LEE
Well then, what's the hurry? Is
it that the rights to Doctor
Zhivago are in arbitration?

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY

CLARENCE
I wanna be able to announce this
deal at Cannes. If I had time
for a courtship, Lee, I would.
I'd take ya out, I'd hold ya
hand, I'd kiss ya on the cheek at
the door. But I'm not in that
position. I need to know if we're
in bed together or not. If you
want my movie, Lee, you're just
gonna have to come to terms with
your fear and desire.
Pause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot.

CLARENCE
(to Elliot)
He wants to talk to you.

ELLIOT
(into phone)
Mister Donowitz?
(pause)
I told you, through Dick.
(pause)
He's in my acting class.
(pause)
About a year.
(pause)
Yeah, he's good.
(pause)
They grew up together.
(pause)
Sure thing.
Elliot hangs up the phone.

ELLIOT
He says Wednesday at three o'clock
at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants
everybody there.
(pointing at
Clarence)
He'll talk to you. If after
talkin' to you he's convinced
you're okay, he'll do business.
If not, he'll say, 'Fuck it' and
walk out the door. He also wants
a sample bag.

CLARENCE
No problem on counts.
He offers Elliot the animal crackers.

CLARENCE
Have a cookie.
Elliot takes one.

ELLIOT
Thanks.
He puts it in his mouth.

CLARENCE
That wasn't a gorilla, was it?

EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY
The red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the
hotel. Alabama hops out, Clarence stays in.

ALABAMA
You did it, Quickdraw, I'm so
proud of you. You were like a
ninja. Did I do my part okay?

CLARENCE
Babalouey, you were perfect, I
could hardly keep from busting
up.

ALABAMA
I felt so stupid just blowing
those bubbles.

CLARENCE
You were chillin', kind of creepy
even. You totally fucked with
his head. I'm gonna go grab
dinner.

ALABAMA
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get
all wet, and slippery, and soapy.
Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed,
not even bother to dry off, and
watch X-rated movies 'til you get
your ass back to my lovin' arms.
They kiss.

CLARENCE
We now return you to Bullitt
already in progress.
He slams the MUSTANG in reverse and PEELS OUT of the
hotel. Alabama walks her little walk from the parking
lot to the pool area. Somebody WHISTLES at her, she
turns to them.

ALABAMA
Thank you.
She gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens her
door.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY
She steps in only to find Virgil sitting in a chair
placed in front of the door with a sawed-off shotgun
aimed right at her.

VIRGIL
(calmly)
Step inside and shut the door.
She doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward.

VIRGIL
(calmly)
Lady, I'm gonna shoot you in the
face.
She does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming
the sawed-off.

VIRGIL
Step away from the door, more
into the room.
She does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then
steps closer to her.

VIRGIL
Okay, Alabama, where's our coke,
where's Clarence, and when's he
coming back.

ALABAMA
I think you got the wrong room,
my name is Sadie. I don't have
any Coke, but there's a Pepsi
machine downstairs. I don't know
any Clarence, but maybe my husband
does. You might have heard of him,
he plays football. Al Lylezado.
He'll be home any minute, you can
ask him.
Virgil can't help but smile.

VIRGIL
You're cute.
Virgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which
catches Alabama square in the face lifting her off of
the ground and dropping her flat on her back.

INT. RED MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY
Clarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat,
singing to himself.

CLARENCE
(singing)
'Land of stardust, land of glamour,
Vistavision and Cinerama,
everything about it is a must,
to get to Hollywood, or bust...'

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY
Alabama's lying flat. She actually blacked out for a
moment, but the salty taste of the blood in her mouth
woke her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil standing
there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream.
They open again to the same sight. She has never felt
more helpless in her life.

VIRGIL
Hurts, don't it. You ain't hurt
that bad. Get on our feet,
Fruitloop.
Alabama wobbily complies.

VIRGIL
Where's our coke? Where's
Clarence? And when's he comin'
back?
Alabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without
a doubt she's going to die, because this man is going to
kill her.

ALABAMA
Go take a flying fuck at a rolling
donut.
Virgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a side kick
straight to the stomach. The air is sucked out of her
lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours
gasping for air that's just not there.
Virgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one
up with a Zippo lighter. He takes a long, deep drag.

VIRGIL
Whatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get
used to it.

INT. HAMBURGER STAND - DAY
Clarence walks through the door of some mom and pop
fast food restaurant.

CLARENCE
Woah! Smells like hamburgers in
here! What's the biggest, fatest
hamburger you guys got?
The IRANIAN GUY at the counter says:

IRANIAN GUY
That would be Steve's double
chili cheeseburger.

CLARENCE
Well I want two of them bad boys.
Two large orders of chili fries.
Two large diet Cokes.
(looking at menu
on wall)
And I'll tell you what, why don't
you give me a combination burrito
as well.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY
Alabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room.
She braces herself against the walls. She is very
punchy. Virgil steps in front of her.

VIRGIL
You think your boyfriend would go
through this kind of shit for you?
Dream on, cunt. You're nothin'
but a fuckin' fool. And your
pretty face is gonna turn awful
goddamn ugly in about two seconds.
Now where's my fuckin' coke?!
She doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse
kick, to the head. Her head slams into the left side
of the wall.

VIRGIL
Where's Clarence?!
Nothing. He gives her another kick to the head. This
time from the other side. Her legs start to give way.
He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her
lightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.

VIRGIL
When's Clarence getting back?
She can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages,
and she gives him the middle finger. Virgil can't help
but smile.

VIRGIL
You gotta lot of heart, kid.
He gives her a spinning roundhouse kick to the head that
sends her to the floor.

INT. HAMBURGER STAND - CLOSEUP - BURGERS - DAY
SIZZLING on a GRIDDLE. Chili and cheese are put on
them.

ANOTHER ANGLE
Clarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER
reading a copy of Newsweek with Elvis on the cover.

CLARENCE
That's a great issue.
The Customer lowers his magazine a little bit.

CUSTOMER
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty
decent one.

CLARENCE
Have you read the story on Elvis.

SUBSCRIBER (CUSTOMER)
No. Not yet.

CLARENCE
You know, I saw it on the stands,
my first inclination was to buy
it. But, I look at the price and
say forget it. It's just gonna be
the same old shit. I ended up
breaking down and buying it a few
days later. Man, was I ever wrong.

SUBSCRIBER
Liked it, huh?

CLARENCE
It's probably the single best
piece I've ever read about Elvis
in my life.

SUBSCRIBER
That good, huh?
He takes the magazine from the Subscriber's hands and
starts flipping to the Elvis article.

CLARENCE
It tries to pin down what the
attraction is after all these
years. It covers the whole
spectrum of fans, the people
who love his music, the people
who grew up with him, the artists
he inspired; Bob Dylan, Bruce
Springsteen, and the fanatics,
like these guys. I don't know
about you, but they give me the
creeps.

SUBSCRIBER
I can see what you mean.

CLARENCE
Like look at her. She looks like
she fell off of an ugly tree and
hit every branch on the way down.
Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat
Boone's dick.
Clarence and the Subscriber laugh.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY
Alabama's pretty beat-up. She has a fat lip and her face
is black and blue. She's crawling around on the floor.
Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the cocaine.
He's also carrying on a running commentary.

VIRGIL
Now the first guy you kill is
always the hardest. I don't care
if you're the Boston Strangler or
Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas
boy, Charles Whitman, the fella
who shot all them guys from that
tower, I'll bet you green money
that, that first little black dot
that he took a bead on, was the
bitch of the bunch. No foolin',
the first one's a tough row to
hoe. Now, the second one, while
it ain't no Mardigra, it ain't
half as tough as the first. You
still feel somethin' but it's just
so diluted this time around. Then
you completely level off on the
third one. The third one is easy.
It's gotten to the point now
I'll do it just to watch their
expression change.
He's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he
flips the mattress up off the bed, and the black suitcase
is right there.
Alabama is crawling unnoticed to where her purse lay.
Virgil flips open the black case and almost goes
snowblind.

VIRGIL
Well, well, well, looky here.
I guess I just reached journey's
end. Great. One less thing I
gotta worry about.
Virgil closes up the case. Alabama sifts through her
purse.
She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up, Virgil
turns toward her.

VIRGIL
Okay, Sugarpop, we've come to
what I like to call the moment
of truth --
Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust out knife in
both hands. Mr. karate man smiles.

VIRGIL
Kid, you gotta lot a heart.
He moves toward her.
Alabama's hands are shaking.

VIRGIL
Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm
gonna give you a free swing. Now,
I only do that for people I like.
He moves close.
Alabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his
shirt and rips it open. Buttons fly everywhere.

VIRGIL
Go ahead, girl, take a stab at
it.
(giggling)
You don't have anything to lose.

CLOSEUP - ALABAMA'S FACE
Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose.
Virgil's also right about this being the moment of
truth. There is a ferocity in women that comes out at
certain times, and it's just there under the surface in
many women all of the time. The absolute feeling of
helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one
hundred-eighty degree turn into "I'll take this mother-
fucker with me if it's the last thing I do" seething
hatred.
Letting out a blood-curdling yell, she raises the knife
high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges
it deep into Virgil's right foot.

CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE
Talk about blood curdling yells.
Alabama is kicked in the teeth with Virgil's left foot.
Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his
foot, tears running down his face.
While Virgil's bent down, Alabama SMASHES an Elvis
Presley whiskey DECANTER that Clarence bought her in
Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster so
it doesn't kill him.
Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.

VIRGIL
Okay, no more mister nice-guy.
Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He
instinctively catches it, and with his arms full of
television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in his
nose, breaking it.
Her eyes go straight to the door, then they go to the
sawed-off shotgun by the door. She runs to it, bends
over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks
her in the back sending her flying over the chair and
smashing into the door.
Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and
stands over Alabama. Alabama's lying on the ground
laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not a
one of them has ever laughed before he did it.

VIRGIL
What's so funny?!!

ALABAMA
(laughing)
You look so ridiculous.
She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off
the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her
through the GLASS SHOWER DOOR in the bathroom.

VIRGIL
Laugh it up, cunt. You were in
hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't
you laughing now.
Alabama laying in the bathtub grabs a small bottle of
hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand.
Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her
hair.
Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her
and his hands go to his eyes.

VIRGIL
Oh Jesus!
She grabs a hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and
plunges it into his face.

VIRGIL
Oh Mary, help me!
The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from
the shower. She's clutching a big, bloody piece of
broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of the Tasmanian
Devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees
the figure coming towards him. He lets out a wild
haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into
the toilet.
She recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain
lid off of the back of the toilet tank.
Virgil whips out a .45 AUTOMATIC from his shoulder
holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head.
He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid
hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight
environment, but he FIRES anyway, hitting the floor,
the wall, the toilet, and the sink.
The toilet LID finally SHATTERS against Virgil's head.
Virgil falls to the ground.
Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big
can of Final Net hairspray, pulls a Bic lighter out of
her pocket, and just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she
flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through
the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits
Virgil right in the face.
He FIRES off TWO SHOTS. One which hits the wall, another
that hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying.
Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up,
knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom.
Virgil collapses onto the floor of the living room.
Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground. He
crawls toward it.
Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She
picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him. It's empty.
She's on her feet and into the room.
He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.
Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife.
She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back.
She hits him.
He arches up, FIRING the SAWED-OFF into the ceiling,
dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and
stucco all over the room.
Alabama snatches the shotgun.
Arched over on his back Virgil's eyes make contact with
Alabama's eyes.
The FIRST BLAST hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing
his arm off. The SECOND hits him in the knee. The
THIRD plays hell with his chest.
Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with
the butt of the shotgun.
Ever since she's been firing it's as if some other part
of her brain has been functioning independently. She's
been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis.

ALABAMA
'Lord make me an instrument of
they peace,
where there is hatred, let me
love,
where there is despair -- hope,
where there is darkness -- light,
where there is sadness -- joy,
oh, divine master, grant that I
may not seek to be consoled --
but to console,
that I may not seek to be
understood --
but to understand,
and it is in dying that we are
born to eternal life.'
Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the
door, gun drawn, only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy
on the head, with a shotgun.

CLARENCE
Honey?
She continues. He puts his gun away.

CLARENCE
Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be
here any minute.
She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she
falls to the ground. She lays on the floor trembling,
still continuing with the downward swings of her arms.
Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses
Alabama over his shoulder.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY
Everybody is outside of their rooms watching as Clarence
walks through the pool area with his bundle. SIRENS can
be heard APPROACHING.

EXT. RED MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY
Clarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in
the passenger seat. She's muttering to herself.
Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the
other stroking Alabama's hair.

CLARENCE
Sleep, baby. Don't dream. Don't
worry. Just sleep. You deserve
better than this. I'm so sorry.
Sleep, my angel. Sleep peacefully.

EXT. MOTEL 6 - NIGHT
A new motel. Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside.

INT. MOTEL 6 - CLARENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT
Alabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is
asleep in bed.

INT. NOWHERE - ?
Clarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly TO
CAMERA. He's in a HEADSHOT.

CLARENCE
I feel so horrible about what
she went through. That fucker
really beat the shit out of her.
She never told him where I was.
It's like I always felt that the
way she felt about me was a
mistake. She couldn't really
care that much. I always felt in
the back of my mind, I don't know,
she was joking. But, to go
through that and remain loyal,
it's very easy to be enraptured
with words, but to remain loyal
when it's easier, even excusable,
not to -- that's a test of one's
self. That's true romance. I
swear to God, I'll cut off my
hands and gouge out my eyes before
I'll ever let anything happen to
that lady again.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT
A wonderful, gracefully flowing SHOT of the Hollywood
hills. Off in the distance we hear the ROAR of a CAR

ENGINE.

EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
VAAAARRROOOOOMMMMM!!! A silver PORSCHE is driving hells
bells, taking quick corners, pushing it to the edge.

INT. SILVER PORSCHE - MOVING - NIGHT
Elliot Blitzer is the driver standing on it.
A blonde, glitzy COKE WHORE is sitting next to him.
They're having a ball. Then they see a red and blue
light flashing in the rear-view mirror. It's the cops.

ELLIOT
Fuck! I knew it! I knew it!
I fucking knew it! I should
have my head examined driving
like this!
(pulls over)
Kandi, you gotta help me.

KANDI (COKE WHORE)
What can I do?
He pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence
gave him earlier.

ELLIOT
You gotta hold this for me.

KANDI
You must be high. Uh-uh. No way.

ELLIOT
(frantically)
Just put it in your purse!

KANDI
I'm not gonna put that shit in
my purse.

ELLIOT
They won't search you, I promise.
You haven't done anything.

KANDI
No way, Jose.

ELLIOT
Please, they'll be here any
minute. Just put it in your bra.

KANDI
I'm not wearing a bra.

ELLIOT
(pleading)
Put it in your pants.

KANDI
No.

ELLIOT
You're the one who wanted to drive
fast.

KANDI
Read my lips.
She mouths the word "no."

ELLIOT
After all I've done for you, you
fucking whore!!
She goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine
instead, it rips open. Cocaine completely covers his
blue suit, at that moment Elliot turns to face a flash-
light beam. Tears fill his eyes.

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
Elliot is sitting in a chair at a table. Two young,
good-looking, casually-dressed Starsky and Hutch type
police detectives are questioning him. They're known
in the department as NICHOLSON and DIMES. The dark-
haired one is Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky
Dimes.

NICHOLSON
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich
bag of uncut cocaine --

DIMES
Not a tiny little vial --

NICHOLSON
But a fuckin' Baggie.

DIMES
Now don't sit there and feed us
some shit.

NICHOLSON
You got caught. It's all fun and
fuckin' games till you get caught.
But now we gottcha. Okay, mister
Elliot actor, you've just made the
big time --

DIMES
You're no longer an extra --

NICHOLSON
Or a bit player --

DIMES
Or a supporting actor --

NICHOLSON
You're a fuckin' star!
And you're gonna be playin' your
little one man show nightly for
the next two fucking years for a
captive audience --

DIMES
But there is a bright side though.
If you ever have to play a part of
a guy who gets fucked in his ass
on a daily basis by throat-slitting
niggers, you'll have so much
experience to draw on --

NICHOLSON
And just think, when you get out
in a few years, you'll meet some
girl, get married, and you'll be
so understanding to your wife's
needs, because you'll know what
it's like to be a woman --

DIMES
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in
the ass. Pussy just won't feel
right anymore --

NICHOLSON
That is, of course, if you don't
catch A.I.D.S. from all your
anal intrusions.
Elliot starts crying. Nicholson and Dimes exchange
looks and smiles. Mission accomplished.

INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN KRINKLE'S OFFICE - DAY
CAPTAIN BUFFORD KRINKLE is sitting behind his desk, where
he spends about seveny-five percent of his days. He's
your standard rough, gruff, no-nonsense, by-the-book type
police captain.

KRINKLE
Nicolson! Dimes! Get in here!
The two casually-dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in.

NICHOLSON DIMES
Krinkle, this is it. We Krinkle, you're lookin'
got it, man. And it's all at the two future cops
ours. I mean talk about of the month. We have
fallin' into somethin'. it, and when I say we,
You shoulda seen it, it I don't mean me and him,
was beautiful. I'm referring to the
Dimes is hittin' him from Haven't had a decent bust
the left about being fucked this whole month. Well,
in the ass by niggers, I'm we mighta come in like a
hittin' him from the right lamb, but we're goin' out
about not likin' pussy like a lion --
anymore, finally he just
starts cryin', and then it
was all over --

KRINKLE
Both you idiots shut up, I can't
understand shit! Now, what's
happened, what's going on, and
what are you talkin' about?

DIMES
Okee dokee. It's like this,
Krinkle; a patrol car stops this
dork for speeding, they walk up
to the window and the guy's
covered in coke. So they bring
his ass in and me an' Nicholson
go to work on him --

NICHOLSON
Nicholson and I.

DIMES
Nicholson and I go to work on
him. Now we know something's
rotten in Denmark, 'cause this
dickhead had a big bag, and it's
uncut too, so we're sweatin'
him, tryin' to find out where
he got it. Scarin' the shit
outta him --

NICHOLSON
Which wasn't real hard, the guy
was a real squid.

DIMES
So we got this guy scared shitless
and he starts talkin'. And,
Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin'
believe it.

CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
Detroit. Very fancy restaurant. Four wise guys,
FRANKIE, LENNY, DARIO and MARVIN, are seated at a table
with Mr. Coccotti.

COCCOTTI
-- And so, tomorrow morning comes,
and no Virgil. I check with Nick
Cardella, who Virgil was supposed
to leave my narcotics with, he
never shows. Now, children,
somebody is stickin' a red hot
poker up my asshole and what I
don't know is whose hand's on the
handle.

FRANKIE
You think Virgil started gettin'
big ideas?

COCCOTTI
It's possible. Anybody can be
carried away with delussions of
grandure. But after that incident
in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil.

DARIO
What happen?

LENNY
Virgil got picked up in a
warehouse shakedown. He got
five years, he served three.

COCCOTTI
Anybody who clams up and does his
time, I don't care how I feel
about him personally, he's okay.

BACK TO KRINKLE

NICHOLSON
It seems a cop from some
department, we don't know where,
stole a half a million dollars
of coke from the property cage
and he's been sittin' on it for
a year and a half. Now the cops
got this weirdo --

DIMES
Suspect's words --

NICHOLSON
-- to front for him. So Elliot is
workin' out a deal between them
and his boss, a big movie
producer named Lee Donowitz.

DIMES
He produced 'Comin' Home in a
Body Bag.'

KRINKLE
That Vietnam movie?

NICHOLSON
Uh-huh.

KRINKLE
That was a good fuckin' movie.

DIMES
Sure was.

KRINKLE
Do you believe him?

NICHOLSON
I believe he believes him.

DIMES
He's so spooked he'd turn over his
momma, his daddy, his two-panny
granny, and Anna and the King of
Siam if he had anything on him.

NICHOLSON
This rabbit'll do anything not to
do time, including wearing a wire.

KRINKLE
He'll wear a wire?

DIMES
We talked him into it.

KRINKLE
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in
internal affairs on this.

NICHOLSON
Look, we don't care if you bring in
the state militia, the volunteer
fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds,
the ghost of Steve McQueen, and twelve
Roman gladiators, so long as we get
credit for the bust.

DIMES
Cocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood.
This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way.
And we found it so we want the fucking
collar.

BACK TO COCCOTTI

MARVIN
May be Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's.
Cardella turns Virgil's switch to
off, and Cardella decides to open
up his own fruit stand.

LENNY
Excuse me, Mister Coccotti,
(to Marvin)
Do you know Nick Cardella?

MARVIN
No.

LENNY
Then where the hell do you get
off talkin' that kind of talk --?

MARVIN
I didn't mean --

LENNY
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella
was provin' what his word was
worth before you were in your
daddy's nutsack. What sun do
you walk under you can throw a
shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick
Cardella's a stand up guy.

COCCOTTI
Children, we're digressing.
Another possibility is that rat
fuck whore and her wack-a-doo
cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil.
Knowing Virgil, I find that hard
to believe. But they sent Drexl
to hell, and Drexl was no faggot.
So you see, children, I got a lot
of questions and no answers. Find
out who this wing and prayer
artist is and take him off at the
neck.

TITLE CARD: "THE BIG DAY"

EXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY - SUNRISE
Clarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just
off of Imperial Highway. As luck would have it, some-
body has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of the
road. Clarence and Alabama sit on the sofa, sharing a
Jumbo Java, and enjoying the sunrise and wonderful view
of the LAX Airport runways, where planes are taking off
and landing. A PLANE TAKES OFF, and they stop and watch.

CLARENCE
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate
airports.

ALABAMA
Really?

CLARENCE
With a vengeance, I hated them.

ALABAMA
How come?

CLARENCE
I used to live by one back in
Dearborn. It's real frustrating
to be surrounded by airplanes
when you ain't got shit. I hated
where I was, but I couldn't do
anything about it. I didn't have
any money. It was tough enough
just tryin' to pay my rent every
month, and here I was livin' next
to a airport. Whenever I went
outside, I saw fuckin' planes
takin' off. I'm tryin' to watch
TV, fuckin' planes takin' off
drownin' out my show. All day
long I'm seein', hearin' people
doin' what I wanted to do most,
but couldn't.

ALABAMA
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on
vacations, startin' new lives,
business trips. Fun, fun, fun,
fun.
Another PLANE TAKES OFF.

CLARENCE
But knowin' me and you gonna be
nigger rich gives me a whole new
outlook. I love airports now.
Me 'n you can get on any one of
those planes out there, and go
anywhere we want.

ALABAMA
You ain't kiddin, we got lives to
start over. We should go
somewhere where we can really
start from scratch.

CLARENCE
I been in America all my life.
I'm due for a change. I wanna
see what TV in other countries
are like. Besides, it's more
dramatic. Where should we fly
off to, my little turtle dove?

ALABAMA
Cancun

CLARENCE
Why Cancun?

ALABAMA
It's got a nice ring to it. It
sounds like a movie, 'Clarence
and Alabama go to Cancun'.
Doncha think?

CLARENCE
But in my movie, baby, you get top
billing.
They kiss.

CLARENCE
Don't you worry 'bout anything.
It's all gonna work out for us.
We deserve it.

MONTAGE
Everyone gets ready for the big day.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY
Dick, Clarence and Alabama are just getting ready to
leave for the drug deal. Floyd lies on the couch
watching TV. Alabama's wearing dark glasses to hide
some of the damage caused by Virgil.

CLARENCE
(to Floyd)
You sure that's how you get to the
Beverly Wilshire?

FLOYD
I've partied there twice. Yeah,
I'm sure.

DICK
Yeah, well, if we get lost, it's
your ass.
(to Clarence)
Come on, Clarence, let's go.
Elliot's going to meet us in
the lobby.

CLARENCE
I'm just making sure we got
everything.
(to Alabama)
You got yours?
She holds up the suitcase. The PHONE RINGS. The three
pile out the door. Floyd answers the phone.

FLOYD
Hello?
(puts his hand
over the receiver)
Dick, it's for you. You here?

DICK
No. I left.
He starts to close the door, then opens it again.

DICK
I'll take it.
(takes the receiver)
Hello.
(pause)
Hi, Catherine, I was just walkin'
out the --
(pause)
Really?
(pause)
I don't believe it.
(pause)
She really said that?
(pause)
I'll be by first thing.
(pause)
No. Thank you for sending me out.
(pause)
'Bye-bye.
He hangs up and looks at Clarence.

DICK
(stunned)
I got the part on 'T.J. Hooker.'

CLARENCE
No shit? Dick, that's great!
Clarence and Alabama are jumping around. Floyd even
smiles.

DICK
(still stunned)
They didn't even want a callback.
They just hired me like that. Me
and Peter Breck are the two
heavies. We start shooting
Monday. My call is for seven
o'clock in the morning.

CLARENCE
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in
the car. We can't be late.
Dick looks at Clarence. He doesn't want to go.

DICK
Clarence.

CLARENCE
Yeah?

DICK
Um, nothing. Let's go.
They exit.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOTEL/LAX - DAY
We see the airport and MOVE IN CLOSER on a hotel on the
landscape.

INT. HOTEL/LAX - ROOM - DAY
Lenny can be seen putting a shotgun together. He is
sitting on a bed.
Toothpick Vic ENTERS the FRAME with his own shotgun. He
goes over to Lenny and gives him some shells.
Marvin walks THROUGH the FRAME cocking his own shotgun.
The bathroom door opens behind Lenny and Frankie walks
out twirling a couple of .45 automatics in his hands.

CUT TO:

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
A room at the Beverly Wilshire. Nicholson and Dimes and
four DETECTIVES from Internal Affairs are in a room on
the same floor as Donowitz. They have just put a wire
on Elliot.

NICHOLSON
Okay, say something.

ELLIOT
(talking loud into
the wire)
Hello! Hello! Hello! How now
brown cow!

DIMES
Just talk regular.

ELLIOT
(normal tone)
'But soft. What light through
yonder window breaks? 'Tis the
East and yonder Juliet is the
sun. Oh, arise fair sun and kill
the envious moon that is sick and
pale with grief --'

WURLITZER
(to the IA Officer at
the tape machine)
Are you getting this shit?
The IA Officer at the tape machine gives a thumbs up.
Nicholson, Dimes, and WURLITZER huddle by Elliot.

DIMES
Now, remeber, we'll be monitoring
just down the hall.

ELLIOT
And if there's any sign of trouble
you'll come in.

NICHOLSON
Like gangbusters. Now remember, if
you don't want to go to jail, we
gotta put your boss in jail.

DIMES
We have to show in court that,
without a doubt, a successful man,
an important figure in the
Hollywood community, is also
dealing cocaine.

NICHOLSON
So you gotta get him to admit on
tape that he's buying this coke.

DIMES
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.

CUT TO:

INT. RED MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY
Clarence, Dick and Alabama en route. Dick refers to
Alabama's beat-up face.

DICK
You got that playing basketball?

ALABAMA
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the
eye. And if that wasn't enough,
I got hurled the ball when I'm not
looking. Wham! Right in my
face.
They stop at a red light. Clarence looks to Alabama.

CLARENCE
Red light means love, baby.
Clarence and Alabama start kissing.

CUT TO:

INT. CADILLAC - MOVING - DAY
Marvin, Frankie, Lenny and Dario in a rented Caddy.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - PARKING LOT - DAY
Clarence, Alabama and Dick get out of the Mustang. Dick
takes the suitcase.

CLARENCE
I'll take that. Now remember,
both of you, let me do the
talking.
Clarence takes out a .45. Dick reacts. They walk and
talk.

DICK
What the fuck did you bring that
for?

CLARENCE
In case.

DICK
In case of what?

CLARENCE
In case they try to kill us. I
don't know. What do you want me
to say?

DICK
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is
not a pimp --

CLARENCE
I know that, Richard. I don't
think I'll need it. But something
this last week has taught me, it's
better to have a gun and not need
it than to need a gun and not have
it.
Pause. Clarence stops walking.

CLARENCE
Hold it, guys. I don't know about
the rest of you, but I'm pretty
scared. What say we forget the
whole thing?
Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.

DICK
Do you really mean it?

CLARENCE
No. I don't really mean it.
Well, I mean this is our last
chance to think about it. How
'bout you, 'Bama?

ALABAMA
I thought it was what you wanted,
Clarence.

CLARENCE
It is what I want. But I don't
want to spend the next ten years
in jail. I don't want you guys
to go to jail. We don't know
what could be waiting for us up
there. It'll probably be just
what it's supposed to be. The
only thing that's waiting for us
is two hundred thousand dollars.
I'm just looking at the downside.

DICK
Now's a helluva time to play
'what if.'

CLARENCE
This is our last chance to play
'what if.' I don't want to do
it. I'm just scared of getting
caught.

ALABAMA
It's been fun thinking about the
money, but I can walk away from
it, honey.

CLARENCE
That rhymes.
He kisses her.

DICK
Well, if we're not gonna do it,
let's just get in the car and
get the fuck outta here.

CLARENCE
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
The three walk back to the car. Clarence gets behind
the wheel. The other two get in. Clarence hops back
out.

CLARENCE
I'm sorry, guys. I gotta do it.
As petrified as I am, I just
can't walk away. I'm gonna be
kicking myself in the ass the
rest of my life if I don't go
in there. Lee Donowitz isn't a
gangster lookin' to skin us and
he's not a cop, he's a famous
movie producer lookin' to get
high. And I'm just the man who
can get him there. So what say
we throw caution to the wind and
let the chips fall where they
may.
Clarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the
hotel. Dick and Alabama exchange looks and follow.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LOBBY - DAY
Elliot's walking around the lobby. He's very nervous.
Clarence enters the lobby alone, carrying the suitcase.
He spots Elliot and goes in his direction. Elliot sees
Clarence approaching him. He says to himself quietly:

ELLIOT
Elliot, your motivation is to
stay out of jail.
Clarence walks up to Elliot, they shake hands.

ELLIOT
Where's everybody else?

CLARENCE
They'll be along.
Alabama and Dick enter the lobby and join up with
Clarence and Elliot.

ELLIOT
Hi, Dick.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Nicholson, Dimes and the other detectives are surrounding
the tape machine. Coming from the machine is Elliot and
Clarence's conversation.

DICK (V.O.)
How you doin', Elliot?

CLARENCE (V.O.)
Well, I guess it's about that
time.

ELLIOT (V.O.)
I guess so. Follow me.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY
The four of them are riding up in the elevator. As
luck would have it, they have the car to themselves.
Rinky dinky elevator MUZAK is playing. They are all
silent. Clarence breaks the silence.

CLARENCE
Elliot.

ELLIOT
Yeah?

CLARENCE
Get on your knees.
Not sure he's heard him right.

ELLIOT
What?
Clarence hits the stop button on the elevator panel
and whips out the .45.

CLARENCE
I said, get on your fuckin'
knees!
Elliot does it immediately. Dick and Alabama react.

CLARENCE
Shut up, both of you, I know what
I'm doin'!

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Pandemonium.

DIMES
He knows.

NICHOLSON
How the fuck could he know?

DIMES
He saw the wire.

NICHOLSON
How's he supposed to see the wire?

DIMES
He knows something's up.

NICHOLSON
He's bluffing. He can't know.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY
Clarence puts the .45 against Elliot's forehead.

CLARENCE
You must think I'm pretty stupid,
don't you?
No answer.

CLARENCE
Don't you!?

ELLIOT
(petrified)
No.

CLARENCE
(yelling)
Don't lie to me, motherfucker.
You apparently think I'm the
dumbest motherfucker in the world,
don't you?! Say: Clarence, you
are, without a doubt, the dumbest
motherfucker in the whole wide
world. Say it!

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY

DIMES
We gotta get him outta there.

NICHOLSON
What'er we gonna do? He's in
an elevator.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY

CLARENCE
Say it, goddamn it!

ELLIOT
You are the dumbest person in the
world.

CLARENCE
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you
thought I am.

ELLIOT
No. No, you're not.

CLARENCE
What's waiting for us up there?
Tell me or I'll pump two right in
your face.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY

NICHOLSON
He's bluffing ya, Elliot. Can't
you see that? You're an actor,
remember the show must go on.

DIMES
This guy's gonna kill him.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY

CLARENCE
Stand up.
Elliot does. The .45 is still pressed against his
forehead.

CLARENCE
Like Nick Carter used to say: if
I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want
you to tell us what's waitin' for
us. Up there. Something's amiss,
I can feel it. If anything out of
the ordinary goes down, believe
this, you're gonna be the first
one shot.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY

NICHOLSON
He's bluffin'! I knew it. He
don't know shit.

DIMES
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's
bluffin'. He just told you so
himself.

NICHOLSON
You're an actor, so act,
motherfucker!

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY
Elliot still hasn't answered.

CLARENCE
Okay.
With the .45 up against Elliot's head, Clarence puts
his palm over the top of the gun to shield himself from
the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what
he's gonna do.
Elliot, tears running down his face, starts talking
for the benefit of the people at the other end of the
wire. He sounds like a little boy.

ELLIOT
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go
home. I wish somebody would just
come and get me 'cause I don't
like this. This is not what I
thought it would be. And I wish
somebody would just come and take
me away. Just take me away. Come
and get me. 'Cause I don't like
this anymore. I can't take this.
I'm sorry but I just can't. So,
if somebody would just come to
my rescue, everything would be
alright.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Nicholson and Dimes shake their heads. They have a
"well, that's that" expression on their faces.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY
Clarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot.

CLARENCE
Sorry, Elliot. Nothing personal.
I just hadda make sure you're
alright. I'm sure. I really
apologize for scaring you so bad
but, believe me, I'm just as scared
as you. Friends?
Elliot, in a state of shock, takes Clarence's hand.
Dick and Alabama are relieved.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Nicholson and Dimes listen open-mouthed, not believing
what they're hearing.

CUT TO:

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY
Floyd is lying on the couch, watching TV. He hasn't
moved since we last saw him.
There is a KNOCK on the door.

FLOYD
(not turning away
from the TV)
It's open.
The door flings open and the four wiseguys rapidly enter
the room. The door slams shut. All have their sawed-
offs drawn and pointed at Floyd.

FLOYD
Yes?

LENNY
Are you Dick Ritchie?

FLOYD
No.

LENNY
Do you know a Clarence Worley?

FLOYD
Yes.

LENNY
Do you know where we can find him?

FLOYD
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.

LENNY
Where's that?

FLOYD
Well, you go down Beachwood...

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S ROOM - DAY
Clarence knocks on the door.
The door opens and reveals an extremely muscular guy
with an Uzi strapped to his shoulder standing in the
doorway. His name is MONTY.

MONTY
Hi, Elliot. Are these your
friends?

ELLIOT
You could say that. Everybody,
this is Monty.

MONTY
C'mon in. Lee's in the can.
He'll be out in a quick.
They all move into the room, it is very luxurious.
Another incredibly muscular guy, BORIS, is sitting on
the sofa. He, too, has an Uzi.
Monty begins patting everyone down.

MONTY
Sorry, nothing personal.
He starts to search Clarence. Clarence backs away.

CLARENCE
No need to search me, daredevil.
All you'll find is a .45 caliber
automatic.
Boris gets up from the couch.

BORIS
What compelled you to bring that
along?

CLARENCE
The same thing that compelled you,
Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire
weaponry to a business meeting.

BORIS
I'll take that.

CLARENCE
You'll have to.
The TOILET FLUSHES in the bathroom. The door swings
open and Lee Donowitz emerges.

LEE
They're here. Who's who?

ELLIOT
Lee, this is my friend, Dick,
and these are his friends:
Clarence and Alabama.

BORIS
(pointing at
Clarence)
This guy's packing.

LEE
Really?

CLARENCE
Well, I have to admit, walkin'
through the door and seein' those
Soldier of Fortune poster boys
made me a bit nervous. But, Lee,
I'm fairly confident that you came
here to do business, not to be a
wiseguy. So, if you want, I'll
put my gun on the table.

LEE
I don't think that will be
necessary. Let's all have a seat.
Boris, why don't you be nice and
get coffee for everybody.
They all sit around a fancy glass table except for
Boris, who's getting the coffee, and Monty, who
stands behind Lee's chair.

CLARENCE
Oh, Mr. Donowitz --

LEE
Lee, Clarence. Please don't
insult me. Call me Lee.

CLARENCE
Okay, sorry, Lee. I just wanna
tell you that Coming Home in a
Body Bag is one of my favorite
movies. After Apocalypse Now,
I think it's the best Vietnam
movie ever.

LEE
Thank you very much, Clarence.

CLARENCE
You know, most movies that win a
lot of Oscars, I can't stand.
Sophie's Choice, Ordinary People,
Kramer vs. Kramer, Gandhi. All
that stuff is safe, geriatric,
coffee table, dog shit.

LEE
I hear you talking, Clarence. We
park our cars in the same garage.

CLARENCE
Like that Merchant Ivory claptrap.
All those assholes make are
unwatchable movies from unreadable
books.
Boris starts placing clear glass coffee cups in front of
everybody and fills everyone's cup from a fancy coffee-
pot that he handles like an expert.

LEE
Clarence, there might be somebody
somewhere that agrees with you
more than I do, but I wouldn't
count on it.
Clarence is on a roll and he knows it.

CLARENCE
They aren't plays, they're not
books, they certainly ain't
movies, they're films. And do
you know what films are? They're
for people who don't like movies.
Mad Max, that's a movie. The
Good, the Bad and the Ugly,
that's a movie. Rio Bravo, that's
a movie. Rumblefish, that's a
fuckin' movie. And Coming Home
in a Body Bag, that's a movie.
It was the first movie with balls
to win a lot of Oscars since
Deerhunter.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
They're all listening to this.

DIMES
What's this guy doin'? Makin' a
drug deal or gettin' a job on the
New Yorker?

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

CLARENCE
My Uncle Roger and Uncle Jerry, both
of which were in 'Nam, saw Coming
Home in a Body Bag and thought
it was the most accurate Vietnam
film they'd ever seen.

LEE
You know, Clarence, when a veteran
of that bullshit war says that, it
makes the whole project worthwhile.
Clarence, my friend, and I call you
my friend because we have similar
interests, let's take a look at
what you have for me.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COP'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

NICHOLSON
Thank God.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Clarence puts the suitcase on the table.

CLARENCE
Lee, when you see this, you're
gonna shit.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LOBBY - DAY
The four wiseguys are at the desk.

LENNY
(quietly, to the
others)
What was that guy's name?

MARVIN
Donowitz.

FRONT DESK GUY
How can I help you, gentlemen?

LENNY
(as he stuffs a
hundred dollar bill
into his pocket)
Yeah, we're from Warner Brothers.
What room is Mr. Donowitz in?

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Lee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it.

CLARENCE
Now that's practically uncut. If
you desire, you could cut it a
helluva lot more.

LEE
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris,
could I have some more coffee?

CLARENCE
Me, too, Boris.
Boris fills both their cups. They both, calm as a lake,
take cream and sugar. All eyes are on them. Lee uses
light cream and sugar, he begins stirring his cup.
Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar.

LEE
(stirring loudly)
You like a little coffee with
your cream and sugar?

CLARENCE
I'm not saitsfied till the spoon
stands straight up.
Both are cool as cucumbers.

LEE
I have to hand it to you, this is
not nose garbage. This is
quality. Can Boris make anybody
a sandwich?
I got all kinds of sandwich shit
from Canter's in there.

ALABAMA
No, thank you.

DICK
No. But thanks.

CLARENCE
No thanks.
Lee continues looking at the merchandise. Alabama writes
something on her napkin with a pencil and slides the
napkin over to Clarence. It says: "You're so cool" with
a tiny heart drawn on the bottom of it. Clarence takes
a pencil and draws an arrow through the heart. She takes
the napkin and puts it in her pocket.
Lee looks up.

LEE
Okay, Clarence, the merchandise is
perfect. But, whenever I'm
offered a deal that's too good to
be true, it's because it's a lie.
Convince me you're on the level.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COP'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

NICHOLSON
If he don't bite, we ain't got
shit except possession.

DIMES
Convince him.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

CLARENCE
Well, Lee, it's like this. You're
getting the bargain of a lifetime
because I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing. You're used to dealin'
with professionals. I'm not a
professional. I'm a rank amateur.
I could take that and I could cut
it and I could sell it a little
bit at a time and make a helluva
lot more money. But, in order to
do that, I'd have to become a drug
dealer. I'm not a drug dealer.
And I don't want to be a drug
dealer.
Deal with cut-throat junkies,
killers; worry about gettin'
busted all the time. Just meeting
you here today scares the shit
outta me and you're not a junkie,
a killer or a cop, you're a
fucking movie producer. I like
you and I'm still scared. I'm a
punk kid who picked up a rock in
the street, only to find out it's
the Hope Diamond. It's worth a
million dollars, but I can't get
a million for it. But you can.
So I'll sell it to you for a
couple a' hundred thousand. You
go make a million. It's all
found money to me anyway. Me and
my wife are minimum wage kids,
two hundred thousand is the world.

LEE
Elliot tells me you're fronting
for a dirty cop.

CLARENCE
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to
tell you anything. He's not a
dirty cop, he's a good cop. He
just saw his chance and he took
it.

LEE
Why does he trust you?

CLARENCE
We grew up together.

LEE
If you don't know shit, why does
he think you can sell it?

CLARENCE
I bullshitted him.
Lee starts laughing.

LEE
That's wild. This fuckin' guy's
a madman. I love it. Monty, go
in the other room and get the
money.
Clarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Nicholson makes a hole with his thumb and forefinger.
Dimes smiles and sticks his finger through the hole.
They are triumphant.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY
The four wiseguys are coming up.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

LEE
(pointing to Alabama)
What's your part in this?

ALABAMA
I'm his wife.

LEE
(referring to Dick)
How 'bout you?

DICK
I know Elliot.

LEE
And Elliot knows me.
Monty brings in a briefcase with the money and puts it
on the table.

LEE
Wanna count your money?

CLARENCE
Actually, they can count it. I'd
like to use the little boy's room.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COP'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
They all stand.

DIMES
Okay, boys, let's go get 'em.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM

- DAY
Clarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door.
As soon as it's shut, he starts doing the twist. He
can't believe he pulled it off. He goes to the toilet
and starts taking a piss.
He hears the RHYTHMIC SNAPPING of a FINGER. He turns
and sees the extreme closeup of Elvis' hand.

ELVIS
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya.
You were cooler than cool.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Everything's just as it was.
Suddenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives
burst into the room, guns drawn.

NICHOLSON AND DIMES
Police! Freeze, you're all under
arrest.
Everybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty
stand ready with their Uzis.

NICHOLSON
You two. Put the guns on the
floor and back away.

MONTY
Fuck you! All you pigs put your
guns on the floor and back away.

LEE
Monty, what are you talking about?
Do what they say.

DIMES
This is your last warning! Drop
those fuckin' guns.

BORIS
This is your last warning! We
could kee all six of ya and ya
fuckin' know it! Now get on the
floor!

DICK
What the fuck am I doing here?

LEE
Boris! Everybody's gonna get
killed! They're cops!

MONTY
So, they're cops. Who gives a
shit?

BORIS
Lee, something I never told you
about me. I don't like cops.

DIMES
Okay, let's everybody calm down
and get nice. Nobody has to die.
We don't want it and you don't
want it.

LEE
We don't want it.
The four wiseguys burst through the door, shotguns drawn
except for Frankie, who has two .45 automatics, one in
each hand.
Half the cops spin around.

WURLITZER
Freeze!

LENNY
Who are you guys?

WURLITZER
Police.

MARVIN
(to Lenny)
Do we get any extra if we have to
kill cops?

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM

- DAY
Clarence and Elvis.

CLARENCE
How do you think I'm doin' with
Lee?

ELVIS
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.

CLARENCE
You don't think I'm kissin' his
ass, do you?

ELVIS
You're telling him what he wants
to hear, but that ain't the same
thing as kissin' his ass.

CLARENCE
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it.
I love Coming Home in a Body
Bag.

ELVIS
That's why it don't come across
as ass kissin', because it's
genuine and he can see that.
Elvis fixes Clarence's collar.

ELVIS
I like ya, Clarence. Always have.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
This is a Mexican standoff, if ever there was one.
Gangsters at one end, with shotguns. Bodyguards at
the other end, with machine guns. And cops in the
middle, with handguns.
Dick's ready to pass out.
Alabama's so scared she's peed on herself. She places
her hand on her stomach.
For Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life and
he's about had it.

ELLIOT
Officer Dimes? Officer Dimes?
Dimes looks at Elliot.

ELLIOT
This has nothing to do with me
anymore. Can I just leave and
you guys just settle it by
yourselves?

DIMES
Elliot, shut the fuck up and stay
put!

LEE
(to Elliot)
How did you know his name? How
the fuck did he know your name?
Why, you fuckin' little piece of
shit!

ELLIOT
Lee, understand, I didn't want
to --

NICHOLSON
Shut the fuck up!

LEE
Well, I hope you're not planning
on acting in the next twenty
years 'cause your career is over,
as of now. You might as well burn
your SAG card! To think I treated
you as a son! And you stabbed me
in the heart!
Lee can't control his anger anymore. He grabs the
coffee pot off the table and flings hot coffee in
Elliot's face.
Elliot screams and falls to his knees.
Instinctively, Nicholson SHOOTS Lee twice.
Lee flops backwards over the couch and onto the floor.
Alabama screams.
Boris lets loose with the UZI, painting Nicholson red
with BULLETS.

DIMES
(screaming)
Cody!!
Nicholson flies backwards.
Vic FIRES his SHOTGUN, hitting Nicholson in the back,
jerking Nicholson's body back and forth and then onto
the floor.
Clarence opens the bathroom door.
Dimes hits the ground FIRING.
A SHOT catches Clarence in the face.
Alabama screams.
Clarences staggers backwards into the bathroom and
falls onto the floor.
It might have been a stand-off before, but, once the
firing started, everybody's either hitting the ground
or running for cover.
Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA officer and
Wurlitzer hit the ground.
Boris dives into the kitchen area.
Monty tips the table over.
Marvin dives behind a sofa.
Frankie runs out of the door and down the hall.
With BULLETS flying this way and that, some didn't have
time to do anything. Two IA officers were hit straight
away.
Vic takes an UZI HIT and goes down FIRING.
Elliot gets it from both sides.
Alabama is crawling across the floor like a soldier in
war, towards the bathroom.
Marvin brings his SAWED-OFF up from behind the sofa
and FIRES. The SHOTGUN BLAST hits the GLASS TABLE
and Monty. Monty stands up, screaming.
The cops on the ground LET LOOSE, hitting Monty.
As Monty goes down, his finger hits the trigger of
the UZI, SPRAYING FIRE all over the room.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY
Cop cars start arriving in twos at the front of the
hotel.

CUT TO:

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Alabama is still crawling toward Clarence.
The suitcase full of cocaine is beside Dick. Dick grabs
it and tosses it in the air. Marvin comes from behind
the sofa and FIRES. The suitcase is hit in mid-air
and white powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped
in cocaine.
Dick takes this as his cue and makes a dash out of the
door.
An IA officer goes after him.
Lenny makes a break for it.
Wurlitzer goes after him, but is pinned down by Marvin.
Alabama reaches Clarence.

ALABAMA
Sweety?

CLARENCE
I... I can't see you... I've got
blood in my eyes...
She starts furiously trying to clear the blood out of
his face.

ALABAMA
Sweety... Sweety... don't you die
on me!

CUT TO:

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - HALLWAY - DAY
Frankie runs down the hall, right into a cluster of
uniformed police.
He FIRES his .45s, hitting two just before the others
CHOP him to ribbons.

CUT TO:

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY
The hallway is empty but we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING
fast. Dick comes around the corner, running as if on
fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the same corner.

IA OFFICER
(aiming gun
at Dick)
Freeze, asshole!
Dick screeches to a halt and raises his arms.

DICK
I'm unarmed!

IA OFFICER
Put your hands on your head, you
sonofabitch!
He does. Then coming from O.S., a SHOTGUN BLAST tears
into the IA Officer sending him into the wall.

DICK
Oh shit!
He starts running again and runs OUT OF the FRAME.
Then Lenny turns the corner and runs down the hall.
Dick runs into the elevator area. He hits the buttons.
He's trapped, it's like a box.
Lenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aims
the sawed-off shotgun.

DICK
Look, I don' know who you are but
whatever it was that I did to you,
I'm sorry.
(looks up, tears
welling in his
eyes)
Oh, God, if you just get me outta
this, I swear to God I'll never
fuck up again. Please, just let
me get to 'T.J. Hooker' on Monday.
Two elevator doors on either side of them open up.
Lenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says:

LENNY
Lotsa luck!
Lenny dives into the elevator car. Dick jumps into
the other.

CUT TO:

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Dimes and Wurlitzer call to Marvin behind the couch.

DIMES
Okay, black jacket! It's two
against one now. Toss the gun
out and lie face down on the floor
or die like all your friends.
The shotgun is tossed out from behind the couch.
Boris has caught a lot of buckshot but he'll live.
He's sitting up against a wall.
Dimes and Wurlitzer have their guns drawn and aimed at
the couch. From where they are they can also see
Alabama and Clarence, although they don't seem to pose
as much of a threat right now as Marvin.

DIMES
Now come out with your hands
raised!

MARVIN
(from behind
the couch)
No!
Dimes and Wurlitzer exchange glances and then look back
at the couch.

DIMES
Why the fuck not!?

MARVIN
'Cause you're gonna shoot me!

WURLITZER
Come out from behind the couch!

DIMES
Now!

BORIS
I need an ambulance!

WURLITZER
Shut the fuck up!

BORIS
I need a fucking ambulance!

WURLITZER
Would you --
Suddenly, Marvin jumps up from behind the couch with a
snub-nose REVOLVER. He BLASTS off THREE SHOTS.

DIMES
That dumb fuck!
Then Dimes notices the blood in Wurlitzer's stomach.
Wurlitzer drops his gun.

WURLITZER
Oh damn. Looks like I took one.
Wurlitzer sits down in the shot-up couch.

WURLITZER
Damn.
Dimes leans next to Wurlitzer.

DIMES
It's not that bad, it's not that
bad... I'll call for an ambulance.
But Wurlitzer is dead.

DIMES
(frustrated)
Shit.
He looks around at the battle zone. The room is torn
apart. Nicholson's headless body is covered with
coke from the suitcase. Dead bodies are everywhere.

BORIS
I need an ambulance.

DIMES
Fuck you!

BORIS
Fuck you! I'm bleeding here!
Dimes EMPTIES his CLIP into Boris until it's clear
Boris isn't going to be needing much of anything.

DIMES
That was for Cody, you sack a
shit.
Then a BULLET cuts through Dimes' solar plexus. A shot
that came from behind. A shot that came from Alabama.
Dimes collapses to the ground.
Alabama is holding Clarence against her. He looks
practically unconscious. Alabama has that fire in her
eyes of a mother lion defending her young. All she
wants, and all she cares about is the man leaning
against her.
She drops the gun to the ground.

ALABAMA
(tenderly to Clarence)
C'mon, sweety, we've got to get
out of here.
They start to hobble out, then Alabama sees something...
the suitcase full of money.
She looks around the carnage of the room, then down at
the suitcase.
And with Clarence under one arm and the suitcase
gripped tightly in the other, she walks out of the room.

CUT TO:

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LOBBY - DAY
Lenny is holding a woman hostage with the shotgun held
to her head.
Fifteen COPS, all with their guns aimed at Lenny, are
trying to talk him out of it.
The lobby is a scene of total chaos.

COP #1
It doesn't have to be this way,
son!

LENNY
(yelling)
Fuck you! I'll blow this bitch's
brains to kingdom come!

COP #2
Put the gun down!

LENNY
I said fuck you! I want a car
here, takin' me to the airport,
with a plane full o' gas... and
a million bucks!
(pauses)
Small bills.
At another part of the lobby the elevator doors open
up. Clarence and Alabama hobble out.
Amid all the chaos nobody (miraculously) notices...
or cares to notice... Clarence and Alabama as they
slowly walk out.
Just before they're out of the building the police
OPEN FIRE on Lenny and yank the woman away from him.
People scream.
Alabama and Clarence slip out the door and into the
parking lot.

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - PARKING LOT - DAY
As they pass the police cars and firetrucks, amid all
the chaos, we hear Alabama's voice:

ALABAMA (V.O.)
Sometimes I'm asked by Clarence
what I was thinking as we walked
a suitcase full of cash under the
noses of a hundred cops.
Alabama and the delirious Clarence get into the red
Mustang. With Alabama at the wheel they drive away.

ALABAMA (V.O.)
I smile and play coy with him and
have never yet told him what was
going through my mind.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. RED MUSTANG (CALIFORNIA COAST) - MOVING - DAY
Clarence is sleeping with his head in Alabama's lap.
His face is covered with bandages. She drives, pensively
thinking to herself.

ALABAMA (V.O.)
Amid the chaos of that day, when
all I could hear was the thunder
of gunshots, and all I could smell
was the violence in the air, I
look back and am amazed that my
thoughts were so clear and true.
That three words went through my
mind endlessly. Repeating
themselves like a broken record.
They pass through the Tijuana border gate.

ALABAMA (V.O.)
You're so cool. You're so cool.
You're so cool.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MEXICO BEACH - DAY
A little boy with nappy black hair and striking blue
eyes runs into his mother's arms. His mother is Alabama.
Next to her is Clarence, wearing an eyepatch. They pick
the little boy up and walk down the beach, their pants
rolled up, the water lapping at their feet, and the warm
wind blowing in their hair.

ALABAMA (V.O.)
And sometimes Clarence asks me
what I would have done if he had
died. If that bullet had been
two inches more to the left. To
this I always smile as if I'm not
going to satisfy him with a
response. But I always do.
I tell him of how I would want to
die, but that the anguish and
want of death would fade like the
stars at dawn. And that things
would be much as they are now.
Perhaps. Except, maybe, I wouldn't
have named our son... Elvis.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
